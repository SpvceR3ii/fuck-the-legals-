# Pyro Inc. Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** May 27, 2025

## Introduction

Pyro Inc. ("**Pyro**", "**we**", "**us**", or "**our**") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard information when you access or use our services – including our website, applications, and hosting services (collectively, the "**Services**").

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and complements our Terms of Service, forming a part of the overall agreement governing your use of the Services. By using the Services, you agree to the Terms of Service and consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy. We are also committed to compliance with applicable data protection laws and frameworks, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and similar global standards.

## Definitions

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the following terms have the meanings defined below:

**Personal Information**: Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. This includes, but is not limited to, a person's name, identification number, location data, online identifier, or factors specific to their physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity.

**Processing**: Any operation or set of operations performed on Personal Information, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure, dissemination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.

**Data Controller**: The entity that determines the purposes and means of Processing Personal Information. For Personal Information you provide directly to Pyro (e.g. your account and contact details), Pyro acts as the Data Controller. In many cases involving data you upload or process via our Services, you (the customer) are the Data Controller.

**Data Processor**: The entity that processes Personal Information on behalf of the Data Controller. When you use our hosting Services to process or store Personal Information (for example, information about your end users), Pyro acts as a Data Processor on your behalf, following your instructions as the Data Controller.

**Cookies**: Small text files placed on your device that enable various features of the Services and collect information about your activities. Cookies and similar technologies (like pixels or web beacons) are used to recognize your browser or device, remember your preferences, and gather usage data.

## Information We Collect

We collect both Personal Information that you voluntarily provide to us and information collected automatically when you use our Services.

### Personal Information

We may collect personally identifiable information ("**Personal Information**") that you provide voluntarily when you register an account, make a purchase, or otherwise interact with our Services. This includes:

**Contact Information**: First and last name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, or other contact details you provide.

**Account Credentials**: Username and password used for your account. (Passwords are stored in an encrypted, secure manner.)

**Payment and Billing Information**: Billing details such as credit card numbers or payment account information. We use secure third-party payment processors (e.g. Stripe, PayPal) to handle payment transactions – such information is transmitted securely and not stored on our servers.

**Communication Records**: Copies of your communications with us, such as support tickets, emails, or chat transcripts, and any other information you choose to provide during interactions with our team.

### Usage and Analytics Data (Automatic Collection)

When you use our Services, we automatically collect certain information about your device and usage of the Services. This data, typically not directly identifying you, includes:

**Usage Data**: Details of your interactions with our Services, such as pages or features you access, the time and date of your visits, the duration of time spent on pages, navigation paths, and performance metrics. This helps us understand how the Services are used and improve the user experience.

**Device and Technical Information**: Information about the device and software you use to access the Services. For example, this may include your IP address, browser type and version, operating system, device identifiers, and other technical details. This information may be collected through server logs and analytics tools for security, analytics, and service improvement purposes.

**Cookies and Tracking Technologies**: We and our third-party partners use cookies, web beacons, pixels, and similar tracking technologies to collect information about your interactions with the Services and to remember certain preferences. This data may include your browser type, referral pages, and other aggregated data.

## How We Use Information

We use the information we collect for various purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. These purposes include, but are not limited to, the following:

- **Provide and Operate the Services**: To create and manage user accounts, provide the hosting and related services you request, process transactions and payments, and offer customer support.

- **Improve and Optimize Services**: To analyze usage trends and feedback in order to improve the functionality, reliability, and user experience of our Services. This helps us debug issues, refine features, and make informed business decisions.

- **Communicate with You**: To send you important administrative or account-related information (such as account confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts), respond to your inquiries and support requests, and provide information about new features or services.

- **Marketing and Promotional Purposes**: To inform you about Pyro products, services, offers, or events that may be of interest to you. We may send newsletters or promotional communications. You can opt out of marketing emails at any time by using the unsubscribe link or contacting us, and we will honor your choice.

- **Legal and Compliance**: To comply with applicable legal obligations, regulations, and law enforcement requests (for example, tax requirements, subpoenas, or court orders). We may process Personal Information as necessary to establish, exercise, or defend against legal claims.

- **Fraud Prevention and Security**: To monitor, detect, and prevent fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful activities on our platform. This includes enforcing our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy, protecting the integrity of our systems, and ensuring the security of user accounts.

- **Personalization**: To tailor the Services to you as an individual user. For example, we may remember your preferences or settings to enhance your experience, or use analytics to display content and recommendations that are more relevant to your interests.

## Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or another jurisdiction with similar data protection laws, we only process your Personal Information when we have a legal basis to do so under applicable law. Depending on the context, our legal bases for processing include:

- **Contractual Necessity**: We process Personal Information to perform our contract with you or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract. For example, we need to process your contact and payment details to create your account and provide the Services you request.

- **Legal Obligation**: We process Personal Information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For instance, we may retain transaction records to meet financial reporting laws or disclose information if required by law enforcement.

- **Legitimate Interests**: We process Personal Information as necessary for our (or others') legitimate interests, provided those interests are not overridden by your data protection rights. This includes uses like improving and securing our Services, preventing fraud, and sending you product updates. We will always consider your rights and interests before relying on legitimate interests as a basis for processing.

- **Consent**: In certain cases, we will ask for your consent to process your Personal Information for specific purposes. For example, we will obtain your consent where required by law for sending marketing communications or for using certain cookies and tracking technologies. Where consent is our legal basis, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.

## Data Controller and Data Processor Roles

Pyro operates in different capacities with respect to Personal Information, depending on the context in which data is collected and processed:

- **Pyro as a Data Controller**: For the Personal Information that you provide directly to us as a customer – such as your account registration details, contact information, and billing information – Pyro Inc. is the Data Controller. This means we determine the purposes and means of processing that personal data, and we are responsible for protecting it in accordance with data protection laws. We use this data for our own legitimate purposes as described in this Privacy Policy (e.g. providing the Services and communicating with you).

- **Pyro as a Data Processor**: When you use our hosting and cloud Services to process or store Personal Information of your own customers, end-users, or other individuals (for example, data contained in your databases, websites, or applications that you host with us), you are the Data Controller of that data, and Pyro acts solely as a Data Processor on your behalf. In other words, we process such data only according to your instructions and for the purposes of providing the Services you have subscribed to. We do not use or disclose your content data except as directed by you or as required by law.

In our role as a Data Processor, we take measures to assist you (the Data Controller) in complying with your obligations under applicable data protection laws. This includes implementing appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect the data (see **Data Security** below), assisting with requests you receive from individuals exercising their privacy rights (to the extent applicable), and notifying you without undue delay if we become aware of a personal data breach affecting your data. We also offer Data Processing Addenda (DPAs) or include equivalent contractual terms in our service agreements to ensure that any processing of Personal Information on your behalf is performed in compliance with GDPR and other relevant laws. These commitments reflect Pyro's responsibilities as a Data Processor and help you meet your own legal obligations as a Data Controller.

## Data Security

We take the security of your information seriously and implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These security measures are designed to be commensurate with the level of sensitivity of the data and the risk of the processing. They include, for example: encryption of data in transit (using Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/TLS technology) and encryption of data at rest, strict access controls and authentication measures (including role-based access and, where appropriate, multi-factor authentication) to limit access to personal data on a need-to-know basis, regular security audits and vulnerability assessments of our systems, network monitoring and intrusion detection systems to alert of suspicious activities, and regular data backups stored securely (with encryption) to enable recovery in the event of an incident. We also ensure our employees are trained on data security and privacy practices, and we require our vendors who process personal data to adhere to high standards of security and confidentiality.

While we strive to protect your personal data, **no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure**. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security. You should also take care with how you handle and disclose your Personal Information and credentials, and notify us immediately if you believe your account or data may have been compromised.

## Data Retention

We will retain your Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, as outlined in this Privacy Policy, and in accordance with our internal retention policies. Generally, this means we keep your information for as long as you maintain an account or subscription with us, or as long as is needed to provide you with the Services. We may also retain certain data for a longer period if required to do so by law or if we have a legitimate business interest (for example, to resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, or comply with legal obligations). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need or legal requirement to process your Personal Information, we will either delete it or anonymize it. If deletion or anonymization is not immediately feasible (for example, because the data is stored in backup archives), we will securely store the data and isolate it from further processing until deletion is possible.

## Cookies and Similar Technologies

**Pyro** uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to provide, customize, and improve our Services. Cookies are small text files that we (or our third-party partners) place on your device's browser when you visit our website or use our apps. They allow us to recognize your device, store your preferences, and gather information about how you interact with our content. We also use related technologies such as web beacons (pixel tags), which are tiny graphics embedded on webpages or emails that help us understand viewing or opening rates, and local storage (which stores data locally in your browser). These technologies serve several purposes, which we have grouped into a few general categories:

- **Necessary Cookies**: These cookies are essential for the operation of our Services. They enable core functionality such as authentication, security, and network management. Without these cookies, our website and Services may not function properly, and certain features or access may be unavailable.

- **Functional Cookies**: These cookies allow us to remember choices you make and provide enhanced, more personalized features. For example, they might remember your preferences (such as your language or region) or other customizations to improve your experience. Functional cookies may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages (e.g. a live chat support widget).

- **Analytics/Performance Cookies**: These cookies collect information about how you use our Services, such as which pages you visit, how long you stay, and which links you click on. We use this information to understand user behavior and to improve our Services – for example, by ensuring users find what they need easily. The data gathered is usually aggregated and anonymized so it does not directly identify individuals.

- **Advertising/Targeting Cookies**: These cookies track your browsing habits and are used to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests. They may limit the number of times you see the same ad and help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. These cookies are usually placed by advertising networks with our permission. They remember that you have visited our website and may share this information with other organizations (such as advertisers) in order to target ads.

**Your Cookie Choices:** When you first visit our site (or after a significant change to our cookies), you may be presented with a cookie consent banner or preferences tool that allows you to accept or reject non-essential cookies. You can manage your cookie preferences at any time by using our cookie settings tool (if available) or by adjusting your browser settings. Most web browsers allow you to refuse new cookies, delete existing cookies, or alert you when new cookies are being set. Please note, however, that if you delete or disable cookies, some parts of our Services might not function properly or your user experience may be degraded. For example, removing functional or necessary cookies could prevent you from logging in or using essential features.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do **not** sell your Personal Information. However, we may share or disclose the information we collect (including Personal Information) in the following circumstances, and only as described below or otherwise with your consent:

- **With Service Providers and Partners**: We may share your information with trusted third-party vendors and service providers who perform services on our behalf. This includes companies that provide services such as payment processing, data analysis, website analytics, email delivery, customer support, cloud infrastructure, marketing assistance, or other services that help us deliver and improve our offerings. These third parties are given access to information only as needed to perform their supporting functions and are contractually bound to keep your information confidential and to use it only for the purposes of providing services to us.

- **Business Transfers**: If Pyro is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information may be transferred to a successor or affiliate as part of that transaction. In such cases, we will ensure that the successor continues to be bound by this Privacy Policy or provides notice to you if any changes to the handling of your Personal Information will occur.

- **Legal Obligations and Safety**: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid legal requests (e.g. subpoenas, court orders, or government demands). We may also disclose information when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (i) comply with our legal obligations, (ii) protect and defend the rights, privacy, safety, or property of Pyro, our customers, or others, (iii) enforce our Terms of Service or other agreements, or (iv) investigate or prevent fraud or other illegal activity.

- **Protection of Rights and Enforcement**: Where necessary, we will share information to enforce our policies and agreements, to collect amounts owed, to combat harmful or fraudulent behavior, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction (in accordance with applicable laws).

- **With Your Consent**: We may share your Personal Information for any other purpose disclosed to you at the time we collect the information or pursuant to your consent. If you direct us to share data with a third party (for example, if you use a third-party integration that requires access to your data), we will do so under your direction. In all such cases, we will only share the information that is necessary to fulfill your request.

## Third-Party Services and Tracking Tools

Pyro utilizes certain third-party services and integrates third-party tracking tools to provide, analyze, and enhance our Services. These third parties may collect or receive some of your Personal Information or usage data in the course of providing their services to us (for example, when we use analytics or advertising partners). We ensure that these third parties are bound by appropriate confidentiality and data protection obligations. Below is a non-exhaustive list of third-party services we use, along with what they're used for and links to their respective privacy policies:

- **Analytics**: We use Google Analytics and PostHog for web and product analytics to collect and analyze usage data, which helps us understand how users interact with our Services and improve them. These tools may record information such as your IP address, browser type, pages visited, and clicks on our site. The data is aggregated and used to generate reports on website and application usage.

- **Advertising**: We use advertising partners to market our Services and measure the effectiveness of our ads. In particular, we utilize Google Ads (including Google Ads conversion tracking and remarketing tags) and Reddit Ads (Reddit's advertising pixel) on our website. These tools place cookies or pixels that track when you have visited our site and whether certain actions (like signing up or making a purchase) occurred, which helps us evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns and deliver relevant ads on external platforms. These services may result in transfers of limited data (e.g. cookie identifiers or IP addresses) to the third parties; however, this information is generally not identifiable to a specific person by those advertising partners.

- **Infrastructure (CDN & Security)**: We use Cloudflare to enhance our platform's performance and security. Cloudflare acts as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and provides DDoS protection and other security services. This means that when you access our Services, your requests may pass through Cloudflare's global network. Cloudflare may collect certain technical information (such as IP addresses and system configuration information) for the purpose of delivering its services and improving network security.

- **Data Storage**: We utilize Backblaze for certain data storage and backup solutions. Backblaze may handle encrypted backups or stored data on our behalf.

- **Payment Processing**: For handling payments and subscriptions securely, we rely on third-party payment processors Stripe and PayPal. When you make payments, the information you provide (such as credit card number, billing address) is transmitted directly to these payment providers over encrypted connections. We do not store your full payment card details on our own servers. These processors are PCI-DSS compliant and use your payment information only to process transactions.

Each of these third-party services only has access to the information necessary for it to perform its function, and they are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party providers to learn more about their data practices. If you have any questions about the third parties we use, feel free to contact us.

## International Data Transfers

Pyro is based in the United States, but we serve a global customer base. Therefore, your information (including Personal Information) may be transferred to, stored in, or processed in countries other than your own. In particular, data that we collect may be transferred to and processed on servers in the United States and other jurisdictions where we or our service providers maintain facilities. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country, and in some cases may not be deemed "adequate" by certain regulatory authorities.

However, we take steps to ensure that your Personal Information is given an **equivalent level of protection** as it would be under the data protection laws applicable to you. If you are located in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, we will transfer your personal data in compliance with applicable data transfer restrictions. This generally means that we rely on appropriate safeguards such as the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for transfers of personal data, or we transfer data to recipients in jurisdictions that have been officially deemed to provide an adequate level of data protection. We may also rely on other lawful transfer mechanisms, such as your consent or the necessity of the transfer for the performance of our contract with you, where appropriate.

Regardless of where your personal data is processed, we will protect it in accordance with this Privacy Policy and take reasonable measures to ensure its security. If you have questions about our international data transfer practices, please contact us (see **Contact Us** below).

## Your Privacy Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction or applicable law, you may have certain rights regarding your Personal Information. We strive to honor the privacy rights of all of our users. Subject to the conditions and exceptions set out in applicable law, these rights may include:

- **Right of Access**: You have the right to request confirmation of whether we are processing personal data about you, and if so, to request a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you, as well as information about how we use and share it.

- **Right of Correction/Rectification**: You have the right to request that we correct or update any inaccurate or incomplete Personal Information that we hold about you. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that inaccurate information is corrected.

- **Right of Deletion/Erasure**: You have the right to request the deletion of your Personal Information. This is sometimes called the "right to be forgotten." We will delete (or anonymize) personal data upon request, provided there is no legal obligation or prevailing legitimate interest that requires us to retain it.

- **Right to Object**: You have the right to object to our processing of your Personal Information in certain circumstances. For example, you can object to processing that is based on our legitimate interests or for direct marketing purposes. If you lodge an objection, we will stop the processing in question unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue that override your objection (or if the processing is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims).

- **Right to Restrict Processing**: You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your Personal Information under certain conditions (for instance, while we verify the accuracy of data you have contested or in lieu of erasure when you oppose deletion). When processing is restricted, your data will just be stored and not otherwise processed until the restriction is lifted (with your consent or otherwise in line with law).

- **Right to Data Portability**: You have the right to receive the Personal Information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and to have that information transmitted to another data controller where technically feasible. In other words, you can ask us to help port your data to another service provider, when this right is applicable (this typically applies to information processed based on your consent or for the performance of a contract with you).

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at **<privacy@pyro.host>**. You may also contact us at **<gdpr@pyro.host>** specifically for requests related to GDPR or European data rights. We will respond to your request in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Please note that we may need to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests (to protect your privacy and security). Verification measures may include logging into your account or providing specific information to confirm your identity. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights.

## GDPR Compliance for EEA Users

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) (or in a jurisdiction with similar laws, such as the United Kingdom), you have certain additional rights and protections under the GDPR regarding the processing of your Personal Information. In general, you have the rights that have already been described in the previous section. For clarity, under the GDPR you have the right to:

- **Access**: Request access to the Personal Information we hold about you (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This allows you to receive a copy of the personal data we process about you.

- **Rectification**: Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete Personal Information that we have about you.

- **Erasure**: Request erasure of your Personal Information when, for example, the data is no longer necessary for the purposes it was collected, or you withdraw consent and no other legal basis for processing applies.

- **Restriction**: Request restriction of processing of your Personal Information, for instance if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.

- **Data Portability**: Request to receive your Personal Information in a portable format or to have it transmitted to another controller, where technically feasible.

- **Objection**: Object to the processing of your Personal Information where we are relying on legitimate interests, and you believe those interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object at any time to processing of your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes.

- **Withdraw Consent**: Where we are processing your Personal Information based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you withdraw consent, we will cease processing the data for which consent was given, provided there is no other legal basis to continue processing.

To exercise any of these GDPR rights, you (or an authorized agent acting on your behalf) can contact us at **<gdpr@pyro.host>**. We may request proof of identity and/or authority to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to anyone who does not have the right to receive it. We will respond to valid requests within the timeframe required by law (generally one month, extendable under certain circumstances) and will inform you if we need additional information to verify or complete your request. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local Data Protection Authority (DPA) or supervisory authority if you believe that we have infringed your data protection rights; however, we encourage you to first reach out to us so we can address your concerns directly.

## CCPA Compliance for California Residents

If you are a California resident, you are protected by additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) amendment. These laws provide, among other things, the following rights:

- **Right to Know**: You have the right to know what personal information we collect about you, the categories of personal information, the categories of sources from which the information is collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting (or sharing, if applicable) the information, and the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information. Upon verifiable request, we will provide you with the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you over the past 12 months, free of charge.

- **Right to Delete**: You have the right to request deletion of personal information we have collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm a verifiable consumer deletion request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies (for example, if we need to keep certain information to complete a transaction, detect security incidents, comply with legal obligations, etc.).

- **Right to Correct**: You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you. Upon verification of your identity and the accuracy of the new information provided, we will correct the information as requested.

- **Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing**: The CCPA gives you the right to opt out of the "sale" of your personal information (as "sale" is defined under CCPA) and, under CPRA, the right to opt out of the sharing of your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising. Pyro does not sell personal information to third parties, and we do not share your personal information for targeted advertising in a manner that is considered a sale or sharing under California law. In the event we ever engage in activities that fall under the definition of a sale or share of personal data, we will provide a clear method for you to opt out (such as a "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" link on our website).

- **Right to Non-Discrimination**: You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment from us for exercising any of your CCPA rights. This means we will not deny you goods or services, charge you different prices, or provide a different level or quality of service just because you exercised your rights under the CCPA. However, please note that if you ask us to delete certain information or opt out of certain uses of information, we may not be able to provide you with services that rely on that information.

To exercise your California privacy rights, you or an authorized agent may submit a request to us through the contact methods listed below (see **Contact Us**). Typically, we will ask you to provide sufficient information to verify your identity (and authority, if through an agent), such as your account information or other details we have on file. We will acknowledge receipt of your request and respond within the timeframe required by law (generally within 45 days, with the possibility of a 45-day extension where reasonably necessary). If we cannot comply with your request, we will explain the reasons in our response.

For requests to opt out of sale/sharing, you may also utilize any automated opt-out mechanisms we provide on our site.

As noted above, Pyro does not sell your personal information. We also do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes that California law would deem unrelated or incompatible with the purpose for which it was collected, without your consent. If you have further questions about our practices or your rights under California law, please contact us.

## Children's Privacy

Our Services are **not intended for individuals under the age of 13**, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. Additionally, in certain jurisdictions we do not allow use of our Services by individuals under a higher minimum age: for example, we do not knowingly offer services to children under 16 in the European Union without appropriate consent. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child under the age of 13 (or under the applicable age of consent in certain jurisdictions) without verifiable parental consent, we will take immediate steps to delete that information from our records. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at **<privacy@pyro.host>**, and we will promptly investigate and address the issue.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update or revise this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, legal requirements, or for other operational reasons. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will notify you by posting the updated Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top. In some cases, we may provide additional notice of significant changes, such as by sending you an email notification or placing a prominent notice on our website or dashboard. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates. Your continued use of the Services after any changes to this Privacy Policy become effective signifies your acceptance of those changes.
