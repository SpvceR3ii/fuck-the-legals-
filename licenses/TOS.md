# Pyro Inc. Terms of Service&#x20;

*Last Updated: May 27, 2025*

This Terms of Service (the "Terms" or "Agreement") is a legal agreement between you (the "User" or "Customer") and Pyro Inc., a Delaware corporation (referred to as "Pyro", "Company", "we", "us", or "our"). By creating an account or using any of Pyro’s websites, hosting services, or related products (collectively, the "Services"), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, you must not use the Services.

Your use of the Services is also subject to our Privacy Policy and any additional policies or agreements referenced herein or provided by Pyro (such as our Acceptable Use Policy and Service Level Agreement). These documents are incorporated by reference into these Terms.

## 1. Eligibility and Account Responsibilities

* **Legal Capacity:** You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to use our Services. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract. If you are under 18 but at least 13 years old, you may only use the Services under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms. Pyro does not knowingly provide services to children under 13.
* **Accurate Information:** You agree to provide true, current, and complete information when registering an account and at other times as required in connection with your use of the Services. You are responsible for keeping your account information (including contact and billing details) up to date.
* **Account Security:** You are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of your account login credentials. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your account. Pyro will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of your account, and you may be held liable for losses incurred by us or others due to such unauthorized use.
* **Authority and Compliance:** If you are using the Services on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms, and in that case "you" and "your" will refer to that entity. You also represent that you (and any entity you represent) are not barred from using the Services under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction (for example, you are not on a government-prohibited or sanctions list).

Pyro reserves the right to refuse registration, cancel accounts, or deny the use of the Services to anyone at our discretion, particularly if these Terms are violated or if we believe doing so is necessary to comply with legal requirements or protect our interests.

## 2. Acceptable Use Policy

You agree to use Pyro’s Services in a lawful, respectful, and reasonable manner. You may not misuse the Services or use them to facilitate harm or violations of law. By using our Services, you agree **NOT** to engage in or facilitate any of the following activities (this list provides examples and is not exhaustive):

* **Illegal Activities:** Using the Services for any purpose that violates local, state, national, or international laws or regulations. This includes transmitting, storing, or distributing any content that is unlawful, defamatory, fraudulent, harassing, or obscene. No content involving child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or exploitation is permitted.
* **Security Violations:** Engaging in malicious cyber activities such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) or Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks, hacking, phishing schemes, spreading viruses, worms, malware, ransomware, or any code intended to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to any system, data, or personal information.
* **Intellectual Property Infringement:** Uploading, posting, or transmitting any content that infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of others. This includes unlicensed software distribution (piracy), trademark or patent infringement, or distributing copyrighted materials without permission (e.g., music, videos, software, or other pirated content).
* **Spam and Abuse:** Sending unsolicited bulk communications, spam, or junk mail through our servers, or operating mailing lists, listservs, or any form of auto-responder or mass mailing on or through the Services in a manner that violates applicable anti-spam laws. Also prohibited is the forging of headers or other identifiers to disguise the origin of any message or transmission.
* **Network Misuse:** Engaging in activities that interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of our network or systems, or those of other customers. This includes attempting to bypass or circumvent any usage limits (e.g., bandwidth or storage caps) or running public proxies, cryptocurrency mining operations, or other processes that excessively tax resources in a shared hosting environment without authorization.
* **Harmful or Offensive Content:** Storing or distributing content that is excessively violent, incites hate or violence, or constitutes harassment or bullying of individuals or groups. This includes using the Services to threaten, stalk, bully, or promote harm against others or yourself.
* **False Information or Identity:** Impersonating any person or entity, or falsely stating or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity in a way that is intended to deceive or mislead others.
* **Other Prohibited Uses:** Any other activity that, in Pyro’s sole discretion, poses a significant risk to the security, availability, or integrity of our Services or that is otherwise illegal, unethical, or objectionable.

**Enforcement:** Violation of this Acceptable Use Policy can result in immediate account suspension or termination without refund. Pyro may also remove or disable access to any content that violates these provisions. We reserve the right to investigate any suspected violations, and we may report unlawful activities to law enforcement or take legal action if necessary. You agree to cooperate with us in investigating and remedying any issue and to indemnify us for any loss or damage resulting from your violation of this section (see **Indemnification** below).

## 3. Fees, Billing and Payment

By signing up for a Pyro hosting plan or service, you agree to pay all applicable fees and charges as specified at the time of purchase or renewal. All fees are stated in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted, and are exclusive of taxes (such as sales, use, VAT, or equivalent taxes), which are your responsibility.

* **Billing Cycle:** Services are billed on a recurring basis (e.g., monthly or annually) according to the billing period you select when purchasing. Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel the Service in accordance with our cancellation procedures. By providing a payment method, you authorize Pyro to charge the recurring fees to your payment method on each renewal.
* **Payment Methods:** You must provide a valid payment method (such as a credit card or other accepted payment provider) and promptly update your account if there are any changes (e.g., card expiration or new card number). If we are unable to process payment using your provided method, we may suspend or terminate your Services for non-payment.
* **Invoices and Due Date:** Pyro will make invoices available through your account portal or send them to the email on file. All charges are due and payable upon receipt or as otherwise specified on the invoice. Late payments may incur interest or late fees at the maximum rate allowed by law, and the Service may be suspended or downgraded until the account balance is paid in full.
* **Disputed Charges:** If you believe an invoice or charge is incorrect, you must contact Pyro in writing (e.g., through a support ticket or email to billing) within 30 days of the invoice date to dispute the charge. Otherwise, all charges will be deemed accepted and final.
* **Price Changes:** Pyro reserves the right to change the fees for any Service (for example, due to changes in our costs or pricing strategy). We will provide advance notice of fee changes via the website, account portal, or email. New prices will apply at the start of your next billing cycle. If you do not agree with a price change, you may cancel the Service before the new fees take effect. Continued use of the Service after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the new prices.

## 4. Refunds and Cancellation

**Refund Policy:** Except as explicitly provided in these Terms or required by law, all payments to Pyro are non-refundable. This includes cases where you cancel the Services before the end of a billing period. Upon cancellation or termination of your account, you will not receive a refund or credit for any unused time in the current billing cycle, except at Pyro’s sole discretion.

* If Pyro offers a time-limited money-back guarantee on certain Services (such as a "30-day money-back guarantee" for new accounts), details of that guarantee will be provided in the service description. Such guarantees apply only to first-time purchases of eligible Services and may be subject to additional conditions.
* Fees paid for one-time setup, domain registrations, or third-party services obtained through Pyro are non-refundable.
* In the event that Pyro terminates your Service without cause (and not due to your breach of these Terms), we may provide a pro-rated refund of prepaid fees for the remaining unused period of your subscription.
* Any approved refunds will be issued to the original payment method (or as a service credit to your account, at our discretion). Please note that banks or payment providers may take additional time to process refunds, which is beyond our control.

**Cancellation:** You may cancel your Services at any time through the account management interface or by contacting our support team. Cancellation requests should be submitted before your next billing date to avoid further charges. When you cancel, your Services will remain active until the end of the current paid period unless you request an earlier termination. After cancellation, it is your responsibility to back up any data; Pyro may permanently delete your data from our servers after the Service ends.

## 5. Service Level Agreement (SLA) and Uptime Guarantee

Pyro is committed to providing a reliable hosting service. While we strive for continuous availability, we provide a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for our hosting Services, which outlines certain uptime commitments and remedies. The full SLA is available at Pyro’s Service Level Agreement, and the key points are summarized below:

* **Uptime Commitment:** Pyro’s target is to maintain at least 99.9 % service uptime each calendar month for the Services. The SLA applies only if the monthly uptime falls below 99.9 %. Uptime is calculated on a monthly basis, and it excludes scheduled maintenance windows and any downtime not caused by Pyro (see next point).
* **Scope of SLA Coverage:** The SLA and any resulting credits apply only to downtime or service interruptions caused by factors within Pyro’s direct control (such as failures in our data-center facilities, server hardware, or internal network). Downtime caused by external factors or "force majeure" events (e.g., general Internet failures, upstream network issues, DNS problems outside our control, DDoS attacks, or customer-controlled software configurations) are excluded from the uptime calculation. Issues resulting from your own misuse of the Service or violation of these Terms are also not covered by the SLA.
* **SLA Credits (Remedy for Downtime):** If we confirm that the Service uptime in a given month was below 99.9 % due to causes within our control, you will be eligible for a service credit. The credit will be your sole and exclusive remedy for the downtime.

  * **Credit Calculation:** For approved SLA claims, the credit amount is determined by calculating your cost per minute of service (based on your recurring subscription fee and billing-cycle length) and multiplying that cost by the number of minutes of covered downtime, then multiplying by 30. In formula form, credit = downtime minutes × 30 × (your cost per minute). The cost per minute is your monthly (or prorated) service fee divided by an assumed 30-day month (43 200 minutes).
  * **Cap on Credits:** The maximum credit that can be granted for any given month is capped at the equivalent of one month’s worth of service fees for the affected Service. Credits, if granted, will be applied to future invoices for your account (we do not provide cash refunds for SLA credits).
* **Claim Procedure:** To request an SLA credit, you must submit a support ticket through the proper channel (e.g., our online support portal) within 48 hours after the resolution of the incident that caused the downtime. The ticket must include relevant details such as the dates and times of the outage, the affected service, and a description of the issue. Pyro will review the claim against our monitoring logs and determine in good faith whether an SLA credit is owed. We will notify you of the claim outcome as soon as reasonably possible.
* **False Claims:** Submitting an SLA claim that is false or fraudulent (for example, exaggerating downtime or claiming for events not covered by the SLA) is a serious violation of these Terms. If we determine that you have knowingly submitted a false SLA claim, Pyro reserves the right to deny the claim and may, at our discretion, charge you for the reasonable costs we incurred in investigating the claim. Repeated abuse of the SLA claim process may result in suspension or termination of your account.

**Scheduled Maintenance:** From time to time, Pyro may need to perform scheduled maintenance or upgrades to ensure optimal performance and security of the Services. We will endeavor to provide advance notice (via email or our status page) for scheduled maintenance windows, and if possible, schedule them during off-peak hours. Scheduled maintenance downtime that has been announced in advance is not counted toward SLA uptime calculations.

**Exclusive Remedy:** SLA credits provided under this section are the only compensation or remedy you are entitled to for downtime or any performance issues with the Service. They will be applied to future service billing and cannot be exchanged for cash or other forms of payment.

*For complete details, please refer to the full Service Level Agreement.*

## 6. Intellectual Property and Ownership

**Pyro’s Intellectual Property:** All rights, title, and interest in and to the Services and Pyro’s website, including any software, technology, platform, templates, trademarks, service marks, logos, content, information, and other materials provided by Pyro (collectively, "Pyro Materials"), are owned by Pyro Inc. or its licensors. The Pyro Materials are protected by intellectual-property laws and treaties. You are not granted any ownership or exclusive rights in or to the Pyro Materials. Pyro grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Services and Pyro Materials solely for the purpose of using the Services in accordance with these Terms. You must not remove, obscure, or alter any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary-rights notices on any Pyro Materials. You agree not to reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works of, publicly display, or publicly perform any of the Pyro Materials, except as expressly permitted by us in writing.

**Your Content and Data:** You retain all rights and ownership of the files, data, text, images, software, or other content that you upload, store, or transmit on our Services (your "Content"). Pyro does not claim ownership of your Content. However, by using our Services, you grant Pyro a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to host, reproduce, transmit, and otherwise use your Content solely for the purposes of operating and maintaining the Services (for example, backing up data, distributing content at your direction, or displaying it to users you designate). This license is only as broad as necessary for service provision and will terminate when you delete the Content or stop using the Services.

**Content Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for all Content that you upload or make available via the Services and for ensuring that it complies with this Agreement and all applicable laws. By uploading or sharing Content, you represent and warrant that:

* You have all necessary rights, licenses, or permissions to use and share the Content and to grant Pyro the limited license above.
* Your Content (and Pyro’s use of it as permitted by you) does not infringe or violate any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other proprietary rights of any person or entity, and that the Content is not defamatory, obscene, or unlawful.

Pyro is not liable for any loss or damage to your Content, and you are strongly advised to maintain up-to-date backup copies of your Content outside of Pyro’s systems. While Pyro may provide certain backup or snapshot services, it is ultimately your responsibility to ensure your data is backed up. If you terminate your account or if your account is terminated by Pyro (in accordance with these Terms), your Content may be deleted from our servers (and may not be recoverable) after a period of time. Please ensure you have retrieved all necessary data prior to terminating the Services.

If Pyro receives a takedown notice or allegation of infringement regarding content you are hosting (for example, a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notice), we may remove or disable access to the alleged infringing content and will notify you as applicable. Repeat infringement may lead to account termination. (Refer to our copyright policy or DMCA guidelines for more detail, if available.)

## 7. Privacy and Data Protection

Your privacy is important to us. Our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in connection with the Services are described in our Privacy Policy, which we encourage you to read carefully. By using the Services, you consent to the collection and use of information as outlined in the Privacy Policy.

**Data Processing and GDPR:** To the extent you use our Services to process personal data (as defined under data-protection laws like the EU General Data Protection Regulation "GDPR"), you acknowledge that you are the data controller of all personal data you or your end users provide to Pyro, and that Pyro Inc. acts as a data processor on your behalf. This means:

* Pyro will process personal data only for the purpose of providing the Services and in accordance with your instructions and applicable data-protection laws. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.
* Pyro offers a Data Processing Addendum (DPA) in compliance with GDPR and other applicable privacy laws. The DPA outlines our obligations as a processor and includes provisions for international data transfers, confidentiality, and cooperation in the event of data-subject requests or security incidents. By using the Services to process personal data of individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or similar jurisdictions, you agree to the terms of Pyro’s DPA, which is hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference (and is available upon request or via our website).
* You are responsible for ensuring that you have a valid legal basis for processing the personal data you collect and store on our Services and for obtaining any necessary consents from individuals. You must comply with your own obligations under data-protection laws as a data controller, which include providing appropriate privacy notices to data subjects and responding to data-subject rights requests. Pyro will assist you in accordance with the DPA and Privacy Policy, for example by giving you tools to access, rectify, or delete personal data stored with us.
* If you are subject to privacy laws (such as GDPR or CCPA) and require specific documentation or agreements in place (for example, Standard Contractual Clauses for data transfers), you should reach out to us or review our DPA. Both parties agree to comply with all applicable data-protection laws in the performance of this Agreement.

**Confidentiality:** Pyro will treat your Content and any personal data in your account as confidential and will not access or disclose it to third parties except as permitted in our Privacy Policy, DPA, or as necessary to provide the Services (e.g., to subprocessors who assist in operations under similar confidentiality obligations), or as required by law or lawful order.

Please note that while we take security seriously and implement industry-standard measures, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security of your data. You are responsible for using appropriate security measures (such as encryption) for any sensitive data you store on our servers. In the event of a data breach involving your personal data, we will notify you and the relevant authorities as required by law.

## 8. Disclaimer of Warranties

Pyro provides the Services on an **"AS IS"** and **"AS AVAILABLE"** basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Pyro disclaims all warranties and conditions, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade.

We do not guarantee that the Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure. While we aim for high availability (as noted in our SLA) and take security measures, we make no guarantee that security measures cannot be breached. You understand that use of the Services is at your own risk. Any material or data downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the Services is at your own discretion and risk, and you are solely responsible for any damage to your hardware or loss of data that results from the download of such material.

No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from Pyro or through the Services, shall create any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms. Pyro does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information or content provided through the Services, and we are not responsible for any errors or omissions or for the results obtained from the use of such information or content.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, so some of the above disclaimers may not apply to you. In such case, any implied warranties are limited to the minimum scope and duration permitted by applicable law.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will Pyro Inc. or its directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, or suppliers (collectively, the "Pyro Parties") be liable to you or any third party for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages whatsoever, including but not limited to damages for lost profits, lost revenue, lost business opportunities, loss of data, business interruption, or any other intangible losses, arising out of or related to this Agreement or your use of (or inability to use) the Services, regardless of the theory of liability (contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise) and even if a Pyro Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

**Aggregate Liability Cap:** Except for liabilities that cannot be limited by law, the maximum total liability of the Pyro Parties collectively for any claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services shall not exceed the amount you have paid to Pyro for the Service in the 12 months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim. If you have not paid Pyro for the use of any Service, Pyro’s total cumulative liability shall not exceed \$100.00 (USD). The existence of multiple claims will not enlarge this limit. This limitation will apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.

Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, in such jurisdictions the liability of the Pyro Parties will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.

## 10. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Pyro and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, and suppliers from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) that arise out of or relate to:

* your use or misuse of the Services,
* your violation of any of these Terms,
* your violation of any law or regulation or the rights of any third party (including intellectual-property rights or privacy rights), or
* Content that you upload, store, or transmit through the Services (including any claims that your Content infringes or misappropriates the rights of a third party or has caused damage to a third party).

Pyro reserves the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (in which case you agree to cooperate with our defense of that claim). This indemnification obligation will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement or your use of the Services.

## 11. Suspension and Termination of Service

**Suspension by Pyro:** We may immediately suspend or restrict your account or access to the Services, with or without notice to you, if:

* we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms (including the Acceptable Use Policy or any other incorporated policy),
* your use of the Services poses a security risk to the Services or any other customer, may harm our systems, or may subject us or any third party to liability,
* we are required to do so by law enforcement or other government authority, or
* you fail to pay applicable fees on time.

During suspension, your data and Content may be inaccessible. We will use reasonable efforts to inform you of the cause of a suspension and what steps you can take (if any) to rectify the issue, but we are not liable for any losses you may incur due to suspension.

**Termination by Pyro:** Pyro may terminate this Agreement and your access to the Services for cause:

* immediately if you are in material breach of these Terms or if your account has been used for fraudulent, illegal, or unauthorized purposes, or
* upon written notice (including email) if you fail to cure any other type of breach within 10 days of our notice to you describing the breach.

Pyro may also terminate this Agreement for convenience by providing at least 30 days notice to you (e.g., if we discontinue the Service). If we terminate without cause, we will refund any pre-paid fees for the remaining period of your subscription.

**Termination by You:** You may terminate this Agreement at any time by canceling your Services and ceasing all use of the Services. Termination requests must be made in accordance with our cancellation procedure (see Section 4 on Cancellation).

**Effect of Termination:** Upon termination of your account or Services for any reason:

* Your right to access or use the Services will immediately cease. Pyro will disable your account and you will lose access to your Content on the Services (unless otherwise provided in a specific retention policy).
* You must immediately cease any use of the Pyro Materials and any licensed resources and destroy any local copies in your possession (if applicable).
* Any fees accrued up to the date of termination, as well as any unpaid amounts for the remaining portion of the term (if we terminate for your breach), shall become immediately due and payable. We may charge your payment method or invoice you for such fees.
* Pyro may delete your Content and account data from the Services, unless legally prohibited. It is your responsibility to backup and retrieve your Content prior to termination. (We have no obligation to retain data after termination, though we may do so for a brief period for backup or legal purposes as allowed by our Privacy Policy.)
* **Survival:** Any provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination (such as intellectual-property rights, disclaimer of warranties, limitation of liability, indemnification, dispute resolution, and others) shall survive and remain in effect.

## 12. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

**Binding Arbitration:** To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Pyro agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services (collectively, "Disputes") shall be resolved through binding arbitration on an individual basis. This means that you and Pyro are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and to participate in a class action or class-wide proceeding. This arbitration agreement applies to all such Disputes, whether based on contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory.

**Exceptions:** This Section 12 does not apply to
(a) small-claims-court cases that qualify for that court;
(b) claims for injunctive or equitable relief regarding intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, or patents); or
(c) in circumstances where applicable law forbids mandatory arbitration of disputes (in which case, the dispute shall be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in Section 13 below). Additionally, either party may seek relief in a court of law for claims that are not arbitrable by law.

**Arbitration Procedures:** The arbitration will be administered by a neutral arbitration organization (such as the American Arbitration Association, "AAA") under its rules for consumer/commercial disputes (as applicable) in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, except as modified by this Agreement. You may obtain information about AAA and its processes at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org) or by phone. If AAA is not available or declines to arbitrate, the parties will agree on an alternative arbitration forum. The arbitration will be conducted in English.

**Location:** If you are a consumer, the arbitration may take place in a reasonably convenient location for you; otherwise, or if the parties do not agree, it will take place in the State of Delaware, USA. The arbitrator(s) may conduct hearings via teleconference or videoconference, and even decide claims based on submitted documents without a hearing if the parties agree or the rules permit.

**Arbitration Fees and Awards:** Each party shall be responsible for their own attorneys’ fees and costs, but if the arbitration rules or applicable law provide for fee-shifting (for example, if you are a consumer and your claim is of a certain type under law), then the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable fees and costs. The arbitrator will have authority to award any relief that a court of law could, including individual injunctive relief or monetary damages, but may not award relief to anyone not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator’s decision and award will be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.

**Opt-Out Right:** You have the right to opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you do not wish to be bound by arbitration, you must notify us in writing within 30 days of first accepting these Terms (your notice must be mailed to our business address or emailed to an address provided for legal notices and must include your name, account information, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement). Opting out of arbitration will not affect any other provisions of these Terms, including the obligation to provide notice of claims and the governing law.

**Class Action Waiver:** You and Pyro agree that all Disputes will be resolved only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. The arbitrator has no authority to consider or resolve any Dispute or issue any relief on a class, collective, or representative basis. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than arbitration, you and Pyro each waive any right to a jury trial and agree that the claim will proceed only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.

**Severability of Arbitration Terms:** If any portion of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable or unlawful for any reason,
(a) the unenforceable provision shall be severed from these Terms;
(b) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of the arbitration agreement or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis; and
(c) in the event that the class-action waiver is deemed unenforceable, any putative class action must proceed in court and not in arbitration.

## 13. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms and any Dispute arising out of or in connection with them or the Services will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, excluding its conflict-of-law principles. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a consumer in a jurisdiction where the laws mandate a different governing law or certain consumer protections that cannot be waived, that jurisdiction’s laws might apply to the extent required by law.

**Jurisdiction and Venue:** Subject to the arbitration agreement in Section 12 above, you and Pyro agree that any judicial proceeding (in cases where arbitration is not applicable or is unenforceable) will be brought in the federal or state courts of Delaware, USA. Both you and Pyro consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts, and waive any objections to inconvenient forum.

The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) does not apply to this Agreement.

## 14. Changes to Terms

Pyro may modify or update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by posting the updated Terms on our website and/or via email or via an in-app notification. It is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically. The updated Terms will indicate the "Last Updated" date at the top. By continuing to use the Services after any changes to the Terms become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to a change, you must stop using the Services and cancel any paid Services.

## 15. Miscellaneous

* **Entire Agreement:** This Agreement (including any documents incorporated by reference, such as the Privacy Policy, SLA, and any other applicable policies or addenda) constitutes the entire agreement between you and Pyro regarding the Services, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications, and proposals (whether oral or written) between you and Pyro. No oral or written information or advice given by Pyro or its representatives shall create any additional warranties or in any way increase the obligations of Pyro beyond those expressly stated in this Agreement.
* **Severability:** If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. The parties will, to the extent permissible, substitute a valid and enforceable provision that is closest to the original intent and economic effect of the invalid provision.
* **No Waiver:** The failure of either party to exercise any right or enforce any provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of that right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Pyro.
* **Assignment:** You may not assign or transfer this Agreement (or any of your rights or obligations hereunder) without our prior written consent. Any attempted assignment in violation of this provision is void. Pyro may assign, transfer, or delegate any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement without your consent, in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.
* **Relationship of Parties:** You and Pyro are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create any partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship between us. Neither party has the authority to bind the other or incur obligations on the other’s behalf without prior written consent.
* **Force Majeure:** Pyro is not liable for any failure or delay in performance of its obligations to the extent caused by events beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, civil disturbances, strikes or labor disputes, electrical or power outages, utility or Internet disturbances, governmental actions, or any other event of similar nature.
* **Notices:** Pyro may provide notices to you under this Agreement by email to the address associated with your account, by postal mail, or through postings within your account portal or our website. It is your responsibility to keep your contact information updated. Notices to Pyro must be sent via our support ticket system or to the contact method designated on our website for legal notices, or by mail to our registered business address (attention: Legal Department).
* **Headings:** Section titles or headings in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.

If you have any questions or concerns about these Terms, please contact us at **[support@pyro.host](mailto:support@pyro.host)** or through our support portal. Thank you for choosing Pyro as your hosting provider.
