# PYRO INC. TERMS OF SERVICE

**Last Updated: June 1, 2025**

## BINDING AGREEMENT

This Terms of Service ("**Terms**" or "**Agreement**") constitutes a legally binding contract between you ("**User**" or "**Customer**") and **Pyro Inc.**, a Delaware corporation ("**Pyro**," "**we**," "**us**," or "**our**").

By creating an account, accessing, or using any of Pyro's websites, hosting services, APIs, software-as-a-service offerings, or related products (collectively, the "**Services**"), you acknowledge and agree to be legally bound by these Terms, including all documents incorporated by reference. Your continued use of the Services following any modifications constitutes acceptance of such modifications. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must immediately cease using the Services and terminate any account you have created.

These Terms incorporate by reference our **Privacy Policy**, Acceptable Use Policy, Service Level Agreement, Data Processing Addendum, and Copyright/DMCA Policy. Violations of any incorporated policy constitute a violation of these Terms and may result in suspension or termination of your access to the Services.

## 1. ELIGIBILITY AND ACCOUNT RESPONSIBILITIES

### 1.1 Age and Legal Capacity Requirements

You must be at least eighteen (18) years of age or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is greater, to use our Services. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent that you possess the legal capacity to form a binding contract under applicable law. You agree to notify Pyro immediately if your legal capacity changes.

If you are between thirteen (13) and seventeen (17) years of age, you may only use the Services under the direct supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms. The parent or legal guardian will be the primary account holder responsible for all actions taken under the account, including payment obligations and compliance with these Terms.

**CHILDREN'S DATA NOTICE:** The Services are not directed to children under 13. Pyro does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. We implement age verification during registration to prevent children under 13 from creating accounts. If you discover that your child under 13 has created an account, please contact us immediately at [privacy@pyro.host](mailto:privacy@pyro.host) so we can delete their information and terminate the account.

For users aged 13-17, we collect only the minimum information necessary to provide the Services and implement additional privacy protections in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar legislation. Parents or legal guardians may review, modify, or request deletion of their child's information by contacting us.

### 1.2 Information Accuracy

You agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete information when registering an account and throughout your use of the Services. This includes providing accurate billing information, contact details, and any other requested information.

You are responsible for maintaining accurate and complete account information and promptly updating it when changes occur. Failure to maintain accurate information may result in inability to access the Services, account termination, or communication delays.

Pyro may verify the accuracy of information you provide. Providing false, misleading, or inaccurate information, or failing to update outdated information, constitutes a material breach of these Terms and may result in immediate account suspension or termination.

### 1.3 Account Security

You are solely responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of your account credentials, including usernames, passwords, authentication tokens, and API keys. You agree to use strong, unique passwords and implement additional security measures such as two-factor authentication when available.

You must immediately notify Pyro of any unauthorized access or security breach by submitting a support ticket through our online portal. You agree to cooperate with Pyro in investigating suspected unauthorized access and implement reasonable security measures as requested.

Pyro disclaims all liability for losses arising from unauthorized account use, including unauthorized transactions, data loss, or service disruptions. You may be held liable for losses incurred by Pyro or other parties due to unauthorized use resulting from your failure to maintain credential confidentiality or implement appropriate security measures.

### 1.4 Authority and Compliance

If you use the Services on behalf of a company, organization, or other legal entity ("Entity"), you represent that: (i) you have authority to bind that Entity; (ii) you are authorized to enter into this Agreement; and (iii) the Entity agrees to comply with these Terms. In such cases, "you" and "your" refer to both you individually and the Entity, with both jointly and severally liable for all obligations under these Terms.

You represent that neither you nor any Entity you represent is barred from using the Services under applicable laws, including by being listed on government-prohibited or sanctions lists such as the U.S. Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals List, the Commerce Department's Denied Persons or Entity Lists, or similar lists in other jurisdictions. You warrant that your use of the Services will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including export control, data protection, and anti-corruption laws.

### 1.5 Identity Verification

Pyro implements privacy-preserving verification measures in compliance with applicable laws, including GDPR Article 8 and the European Data Protection Board's Age Assurance Statement (2025). Our verification system may include:

(a) Age gates during registration;
(b) Technical estimation methods that don't retain biometric data;
(c) Third-party verification services for high-risk features; and
(d) Parental consent verification for underage users.

Pyro may request additional verification at any time, including government-issued identification or other reasonable means of confirming your identity and age. You agree to cooperate with such requests within a reasonable timeframe.

All verification data is processed according to our Privacy Policy and subject to a documented Data Protection Impact Assessment. Pyro explicitly prohibits the secondary processing of age verification data for profiling, marketing, or any purpose other than confirming eligibility to use the Services.

Providing false information regarding your age or identity constitutes a material breach of these Terms and may result in account termination, forfeiture of prepaid fees, and potential legal action. Pyro may report suspected fraudulent activities to appropriate authorities.

### 1.6 Account Registration Discretion

Pyro reserves the right to refuse registration, cancel accounts, or deny Service access to any individual or entity at our sole discretion, particularly when these Terms have been violated or when necessary to comply with legal requirements or protect our legitimate business interests. Pyro shall not be liable for exercising this right.

If Pyro refuses registration or terminates an account under this section, fees paid in advance for unused Services may be refunded on a pro-rata basis at Pyro's discretion, unless termination results from a violation of these Terms or applicable law, in which case no refund will be provided.

## 2. ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY

You must use the Services only for legitimate purposes in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards.

This Acceptable Use Policy is a material condition of your right to access and use the Services.

Pyro will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement as described in Section 17 (Copyright/DMCA Policy).

### 2.5 Spam and Abusive Communications

You shall not use the Services for spam, unsolicited bulk communications, or abusive messaging practices, including:

(a) Sending unsolicited commercial messages in violation of anti-spam laws (CAN-SPAM Act, CASL, EU Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive, etc.);

(b) Operating mailing lists or mass mailings without proper recipient consent;

Such activities may violate anti-spam laws, resulting in significant penalties and potentially causing your IP addresses or domains to be blocklisted, impairing legitimate communications.

### 2.6 Resource Usage and Network Integrity

(g) Testing, scanning, or probing Pyro's systems for vulnerabilities.

Pyro operates a shared hosting environment with resources allocated among multiple customers. You agree to use resources reasonably without interfering with other customers' operations or Pyro's service delivery.

Applications with unusual resource requirements require prior authorization and may necessitate a service plan upgrade. Pyro may throttle, suspend, or terminate services consuming excessive resources without authorization.

### 2.7 Harmful Content

You shall not store or distribute content that is excessively violent, incites hatred or violence, or constitutes harassment or bullying, including:

(a) Content depicting or promoting violence or harm against persons or animals;

(b) Content promoting hatred, discrimination, or violence against protected groups;

(c) Content constituting harassment, bullying, intimidation, or stalking;

(d) Content threatening or promoting harm to others or self-harm;

(e) Content designed to shock or disturb without legitimate purpose; or

(f) Content otherwise objectionable as determined by Pyro.

Pyro reserves the right to determine what constitutes harmful content, considering context, audience, legal standards, and community standards.

You acknowledge that content acceptable in one context may be harmful in another and agree to exercise good judgment regarding potential impact when sharing content through the Services.

### 2.8 Misrepresentation and Impersonation

You shall not impersonate others or misrepresent your affiliations to deceive or mislead, including:

(a) Creating accounts under false identities or using others' identities without authorization;

(b) Falsely claiming to be an employee, representative, or partner of any entity;

(c) Falsely claiming endorsement, affiliation, or sponsorship;

(d) Creating deceptive online presences that appear to be operated by others;

(e) Using others' trademarks or brand features to imply unauthorized affiliation; or

This prohibition covers creating accounts under false pretenses for fraudulent purposes, spreading misinformation, or evading prior suspensions.

Identity misrepresentation may violate fraud, impersonation, and deceptive trade practices laws, potentially resulting in civil and criminal liability.

### 2.9 Other Prohibited Uses

You shall not use the Services for any activity that, in Pyro's discretion, poses a significant risk to the security, availability, or integrity of our Services, or that is illegal, unethical, or objectionable. This prohibition is intentionally broad to cover any use inconsistent with the spirit of these Terms, even if not explicitly prohibited elsewhere.

Pyro may expand this list of prohibited activities without prior notice. You are responsible for regularly reviewing this policy to ensure compliance with updates.

### 2.10 Monitoring and Enforcement

Pyro may monitor your Service use to ensure compliance with this policy. Monitoring will be conducted only when necessary and proportionate to ensure security, detect violations, or comply with legal obligations.

You consent to such monitoring activities. Pyro is not obligated to monitor your use and does not guarantee detection of all violations.

#### 2.10.1 Monitoring Safeguards

Pyro implements these monitoring safeguards:

(a) Human review of content is limited to:
   (i) Investigating suspected violations based on documented indicators;
   (ii) Responding to valid legal requests;
   (iii) Addressing security vulnerabilities or fraud; or
   (iv) Situations where you've provided explicit consent.

   (v) Transparency reporting.

(e) A user-facing monitoring policy is available with additional details.

### 2.11 Enforcement

Violations of this policy may result in immediate account suspension or termination without refund. Enforcement severity will be determined by Pyro based on the nature and severity of the violation, intent, repeat offenses, and other relevant factors.

Pyro reserves the right to:

(a) Remove or disable violating content;

(b) Issue warnings or temporary suspensions;

(c) Restrict feature access;

(d) Investigate suspected violations;

(e) Report unlawful activities to authorities or affected parties;

(f) Cooperate with legal investigations;

(g) Take legal action when necessary; and

(h) Take other appropriate responsive actions.

You agree to cooperate with Pyro in investigating and remedying violations, including providing requested information and assistance.

You agree to indemnify Pyro for losses resulting from your violations, as detailed in Section 10 (Indemnification), including costs from third-party claims arising from your violations.

## 3. FEES AND BILLING

### 3.1 Fee Structure

By signing up for Pyro services, you agree to pay all applicable fees as specified at purchase, renewal, or as modified in accordance with these Terms. All fees are in US dollars unless otherwise noted and exclude applicable taxes, levies, or duties.

You are solely responsible for paying all taxes associated with your purchase and use of the Services (sales tax, VAT, GST, etc.). If Pyro must collect taxes, the appropriate amount will be invoiced to you, unless you provide a valid tax exemption certificate.

Service fees vary based on your selected plan, optional features, usage-based charges exceeding allowances, and available promotions. You agree to pay the fees for your selected Services as set forth in our pricing information or any separate agreement between you and Pyro.

### 3.2 Billing Cycle and Automatic Renewal

Services are billed on a recurring basis according to your selected billing period (monthly, quarterly, annually, or other offered periods). The initial Billing Cycle begins when your purchase is processed and your account is activated.

#### 3.2.1 Automatic Renewal Terms

**IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING AUTOMATIC RENEWAL:**

By subscribing, you agree that:

- Your subscription automatically renews for successive periods of equal duration
- Renewal price will be the then-current rate for your plan
- We will charge the payment method on file
- Renewal continues until you cancel
- **Cancellation Options**:
  - **Online**: Through your account settings via the "Cancel Subscription" button
  - **Email**: By emailing <billing@pyro.host>
- Cancellation requests are acknowledged within 24 hours
- For any subscription with a renewal period beyond 31 days, we send annual reminders with renewal terms
- Continuing after a free trial constitutes consent to begin paid charges

You are responsible for monitoring renewal dates and canceling unwanted services before renewal. California residents have additional rights under the California Automatic Renewal Law (2024), including cancellation by the same method used to subscribe.

By providing payment information, you authorize Pyro to charge recurring fees without further authorization until you cancel or update your payment method.

For annual/multi-year subscriptions, we'll send renewal notifications 30 days prior to charging. Monthly subscriptions receive reminders 7 days before renewal. Failure to receive notifications doesn't relieve payment responsibility or justify cancellation of processed renewals.

### 3.3 Payment Methods

You must provide and maintain a valid payment method (credit card, debit card, PayPal, bank transfer, or other accepted method) for as long as you maintain an active account. Acceptable payment methods may vary by region and may change at Pyro's discretion.

You represent that you are authorized to use any payment method you provide, and that all payment information is accurate and complete. You agree to promptly update your account information when payment details change.

If your payment method expires, is declined, or fails, you agree to promptly provide an alternative valid payment method. Failure to maintain a valid payment method may result in service suspension or termination as described in Section 3.7.

Pyro uses third-party payment processors subject to their terms and privacy policies. Pyro does not store complete credit card information and is not responsible for payment information security after transmission to our processors.

### 3.4 Invoices and Payment Terms

Invoices are available through your account portal or sent to your registered email. You are responsible for maintaining a valid email address and regularly reviewing your account portal. Failure to receive an invoice doesn't relieve your payment obligation.

All charges are due upon invoice receipt or as specified on the invoice. For recurring subscriptions, payment is typically processed on the renewal date, though Pyro may process payments up to five (5) business days before renewal to ensure service continuity.

You agree to pay all amounts in full without deduction, set-off, counterclaim, or withholding, except as legally required. If legally required to make deductions, you shall pay additional amounts to ensure Pyro receives the full amount otherwise due.

Late payments may incur interest at the maximum legally permitted rate (minimum 1.5% monthly) from the due date until paid. Pyro may impose late payment fees up to $25.00 (or the legal maximum) per late payment.

Services may be suspended, downgraded, or terminated until full payment, including late fees and interest. Service interruptions due to non-payment may result in data or functionality loss, for which Pyro assumes no liability.

### 3.5 Disputed Charges

To dispute an incorrect charge, you must contact Pyro in writing (via support ticket or email to <billing@pyro.host>) within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Your notice must include:

(a) Account information (name and customer ID);
(b) Invoice number and date;
(c) Specific disputed amount;
(d) Detailed explanation of the dispute; and
(e) Supporting documentation.

Pyro will review disputes in good faith and respond within fifteen (15) business days of receiving complete notice. During review, you must pay all undisputed amounts to avoid late fees or service interruptions.

Failure to dispute charges within thirty (30) days means all charges are deemed accepted and final, waiving future dispute rights. This provides billing certainty and allows Pyro to close financial records for past periods.

If Pyro determines a charge was erroneous, your account will be credited. Credits apply to future invoices unless your account is terminated, in which case Pyro will issue a refund to your original payment method or by mutually agreed means.

### 3.6 Price Changes

Pyro may change service fees at any time. Price changes may result from cost changes, inflation, market conditions, feature changes, strategic repositioning, or pricing strategy adjustments.

For existing subscribers, we provide advance notice of fee changes via website, account portal, or email. Notice periods are at least thirty (30) days for monthly subscriptions and sixty (60) days for annual or longer subscriptions.

New prices apply at the start of your next Billing Cycle after the notice period. For prepaid services, new prices apply only after your prepaid term ends, unless otherwise specified in your agreement.

If you disagree with a price change, you may cancel before the new fees take effect by following the procedures in Section 4. Continued service use after the effective date constitutes acceptance of new pricing.

Promotional or discounted pricing is temporary and expires according to the offer terms. Expiration of promotional pricing is not considered a "price change" and may not be subject to the notice requirements described above.

### 3.7 Non-Payment Consequences

If payment processing fails or you fail to pay when due, Pyro will attempt to contact you using your account information via email, in-app notifications, or other means.

If payment remains outstanding after initial notification, Pyro may:

(a) Assess late fees and interest charges (per Section 3.4);

(b) Suspend service access until payment is received;

(c) Downgrade your service to a free or reduced functionality tier;

(d) Terminate your account and delete data per retention policies;

(e) Refer your account to collections or initiate legal proceedings; or

(f) Take other actions permitted by these Terms or law.

You acknowledge that service suspension or termination due to non-payment may result in data loss, for which Pyro bears no liability. Service restoration following payment may not be immediate and may require processing time.

### 3.8 Collection Costs

If Pyro must pursue collection of unpaid fees, you agree to reimburse all associated costs, including:

(a) Attorneys' fees and legal costs;
(b) Court costs and filing fees;
(c) Collection agency fees;
(d) Process server fees;
(e) Credit reporting costs;
(f) Expert witness fees; and
(g) Other reasonable collection expenses.

You agree to pay interest on unpaid balances at the maximum legally permitted rate until paid in full.

In legal proceedings, the prevailing party shall recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, even if exceeding the amount in controversy. You agree that Pyro may pursue collection in Delaware (its principal place of business) or in any jurisdiction where you maintain your principal business or residence.

### 3.9 Taxes and Exemptions

You are responsible for all applicable taxes related to your use of the Services. If tax-exempt, you must provide valid documentation before the initial billing date to avoid tax charges.

If you provide tax exemption documentation after taxes have been collected, Pyro will apply the exemption to future invoices but is not obligated to refund previously collected taxes.

You acknowledge that tax laws and Pyro's collection obligations may change over time. You agree to provide updated exemption documentation upon request to confirm continued eligibility.

If Pyro determines it failed to collect legally required taxes, you agree to promptly remit such taxes upon notification, even after termination of these Terms.

## 4. REFUNDS AND CANCELLATION

### 4.1 Refund Policy

All payments to Pyro are non-refundable except as explicitly provided in these Terms or required by law. This non-refundability is a material term reflecting Pyro's costs in provisioning and maintaining Services regardless of usage duration. This policy applies when you cancel before a billing period ends, use only portion of features, or are dissatisfied for reasons not constituting Pyro's material breach.

Upon cancellation or termination, you will not receive refunds or credits for unused time in the current billing cycle, except at Pyro's discretion. This policy is reasonable given the nature of cloud services and their provisioning costs.

Pyro may, at its discretion, issue refunds or credits in exceptional circumstances such as extended service outages (per SLA in Section 5), demonstrable billing errors, or situations where Pyro determines a refund is appropriate for customer relations or business ethics.

### 4.2 Money-Back Guarantees

When Pyro offers time-limited money-back guarantees (e.g., "30-day money-back guarantee"), specific details will be provided in the service description or promotional materials. Such guarantees apply only to first-time purchases by new customers and may have additional conditions as specified in the guarantee terms.

To qualify for a money-back guarantee refund, you must:

(a) Request the refund within the specified period;

(b) Submit your request through designated channels;

(c) Provide a cancellation reason; and

(d) Comply with any other specified requirements.

Money-back guarantees allow new customers to evaluate Services without financial risk and are not intended for repeated or abusive use. Pyro may deny refund requests determined to be abusive or fraudulent, such as repeated subscription/cancellation cycles or patterns designed to exploit the guarantee policy.

### 4.3 Non-Refundable Services

The following fees are non-refundable under any circumstances, unless required by law:

(a) One-time setup, installation, or professional services fees;

(b) Domain registration, SSL certificate, or other third-party service fees;

(c) Services explicitly marked as non-refundable;

(d) Fees for fully utilized services (e.g., consumed bandwidth or storage);

(e) Fees for services where you violated the Acceptable Use Policy or material terms; and

(f) Transaction fees, currency conversion fees, or payment processing charges.

You acknowledge these exclusions are reasonable given the nature of these services and Pyro's costs in providing them.

### 4.4 Refunds for Termination by Pyro

If Pyro terminates your Service without cause (not due to your breach), we may, at our discretion, provide a pro-rated refund for the unused subscription period. "Without cause" means termination for reasons other than:

(a) Your violation of Terms or policies;

(b) Fraudulent, illegal, or abusive activities;

(c) Payment failure;

(d) Security risks or potential liability; or

(e) Compliance with law or regulatory orders.

If terminated for any of these reasons, no refund will be provided, and you may remain liable for unpaid fees for the remainder of your subscription term.

### 4.5 Refund Processing

Approved refunds will be issued to your original payment method or, at Pyro's discretion, as service credit for future purchases.

Refund processing times vary by payment method:

(a) Credit card refunds: 5-10 business days;

(b) PayPal refunds: 3-5 business days;

(c) Bank transfers/ACH: 7-14 business days;

(d) Other methods: timeframes vary.

Banks or payment providers may require additional processing time beyond Pyro's control. Pyro's refund obligation is satisfied when the refund is initiated or service credit applied, regardless of when it appears in your account.

### 4.6 Cancellation Procedures

You may cancel your Services through:

(a) The "Cancel Subscription" button in your account interface;

(b) Our support ticket system; or

(c) Emailing <billing@pyro.host> with subject "Cancel Subscription".

We make cancellation as simple as sign-up, requiring no more steps than the sign-up process and no additional information or obstacles.

Submit cancellation requests before your next billing date, preferably at least three (3) business days prior to ensure processing time.

Upon cancellation, Services remain active until the end of your current paid period unless you request earlier termination. Early termination does not result in refunds except as provided in Section 4.10.

You will receive confirmation of your cancellation request specifying the deactivation date. If you don't receive confirmation within 24 hours, contact support to verify your request was processed.

### 4.7 Data Retention After Cancellation

After cancellation or termination, you are solely responsible for backing up data stored on our servers before the termination date. Pyro may permanently delete your data after service ends according to our retention policies, which may include immediate deletion or short retention periods depending on service and data type.

Unless otherwise specified in our Privacy Policy or DPA, our typical post-termination retention periods are:

(a) Account and billing records: Up to seven (7) years for tax and accounting purposes;

(b) Customer Content: Deleted within thirty (30) days after termination;

(c) System logs and operational data: Up to ninety (90) days; and

(d) Backups: Purged within ninety (90) days.

These periods may be modified at Pyro's discretion or as legally required. Pyro makes no guarantee regarding data availability after termination and strongly recommends maintaining your own backups of all important data.

### 4.8 Account Reactivation

To reactivate your account after cancellation but before data deletion, contact support through our online portal. Reactivation may be possible subject to:

(a) Payment of outstanding balances;

(b) Payment of applicable reactivation fees;

(c) Availability of your previous identifiers; and

(d) Compliance with other specified requirements.

Reactivation is not guaranteed and depends on Pyro's discretion and technical feasibility of restoring your account and data.

### 4.9 Account Abandonment

Accounts with no activity for twelve (12) consecutive months may be deemed abandoned. "Activity" includes logging in, using services, making/receiving payments, or responding to communications.

Pyro may terminate abandoned accounts and delete associated data after providing thirty (30) days' notice to your registered email. This notice will:

(a) Identify the account as potentially abandoned;

(b) Specify the termination date if no activity occurs;

(c) Explain prevention methods; and

(d) Provide data backup instructions.

You are responsible for maintaining current contact information and regularly accessing your account to prevent abandonment classification. Pyro assumes no liability for terminating abandoned accounts or deleting associated data.

If you believe your account was incorrectly classified as abandoned, contact support within thirty (30) days of termination to request review. Pyro may reinstate accounts if incorrectly classified or if circumstances warrant reinstatement.

## 5. SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT (SLA)

### 5.1 SLA Scope

This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") is a legally binding component of these Terms that outlines Pyro's service availability and performance commitments. This SLA applies to all paid subscription plans unless otherwise specified in a separate agreement. Free or trial accounts are not covered unless explicitly stated in the service description.

This SLA represents Pyro's sole obligation and your exclusive remedy for service availability failures. You acknowledge that the remedies provided are reasonable and appropriate given the nature of the Services and fees charged.

### 5.2 Definitions

For this SLA:

**"Service Uptime"**: Percentage of minutes in a calendar month when the core platform is available and operational, calculated as: (Total Minutes - Downtime Minutes) ÷ Total Minutes × 100%.

**"Downtime"**: Any period of at least sixty (60) consecutive seconds when Services are unavailable or substantially degraded for reasons within Pyro's control, as verified by Pyro's monitoring. Issues lasting less than 60 consecutive seconds are not considered Downtime.

**"Scheduled Maintenance"**: Maintenance or upgrades on Pyro's systems with at least 24 hours' advance notice. Typically performed during off-peak hours to minimize disruption.

**"Emergency Maintenance"**: Unplanned but necessary work to maintain security, stability, or performance. Due to urgency, advance notice may be limited or not possible.

**"Monthly Fee"**: The recurring fee paid for the affected Service during the month when Downtime occurred, excluding one-time fees, usage charges, or add-on fees.

**"Service Credit"**: Credit applied to your account for future invoices, calculated as specified in Section 5.5.

### 5.3 Uptime Commitment

Pyro targets 99.9% minimum Service Uptime each calendar month for standard hosting services, equating to approximately 43.2 minutes maximum permitted Downtime per month.

If monthly Service Uptime falls below 99.9% for reasons within Pyro's control, you are eligible for Service Credits per Section 5.5, provided you follow claim procedures in Section 5.6.

Different service tiers may have different uptime commitments. If you've subscribed to a tier with a different commitment, that percentage supersedes the standard 99.9%.

Pyro uses industry-standard monitoring tools from multiple geographic locations to measure Service Uptime. Pyro's monitoring systems are the definitive source for determining Uptime and Downtime for SLA purposes.

### 5.4 SLA Exclusions

The following are excluded from Downtime calculations and do not entitle you to Service Credits:

(a) Scheduled Maintenance with at least 24 hours' notice, typically conducted during off-peak hours (10:00 PM-6:00 AM in the service deployment time zone);

(b) Emergency Maintenance not exceeding 60 minutes in any 24-hour period;

(c) Force majeure events as defined in Section 15;

(d) Issues caused by your equipment, software, configurations, or elements not directly controlled by Pyro, including:
   (i) Your applications, scripts, or code;
   (ii) Third-party integrations;
   (iii) Your configuration changes;
   (iv) Improper service use; or
   (v) Non-compliance with technical requirements;

(e) Issues caused by elements outside Pyro's direct control, including:
   (i) Internet connectivity between you and Pyro;
   (ii) External DNS or domain services;
   (iii) Third-party networks or providers;
   (iv) Client-side issues; or
   (v) Third-party attacks (DDoS, hacking, etc.);

(f) Service suspensions or terminations in accordance with these Terms;

(g) Downtime affecting only specific features while core functionality remains operational;

(h) Beta, preview, or early access features explicitly designated as such;

(i) Issues affecting individual accounts that don't impact most users.

These exclusions are reasonable given the nature of cloud services and Pyro's limited control over certain service delivery aspects.

### 5.5 Service Credits

If monthly Service Uptime falls below 99.9% for reasons within Pyro's control, and you follow claim procedures in Section 5.6, you may receive Service Credits calculated as:

`Service Credit (USD) = Eligible Downtime Minutes × 30 × (Monthly Fee ÷ 43,200)`

"Eligible Downtime Minutes" means Downtime minutes not excluded under Section 5.4.

Maximum Service Credit is capped at 100% of the Monthly Fee for the affected Service, regardless of actual Downtime.

Service Credit limitations:

(a) Credits apply to future invoices only with no cash value, applied to your next billing cycle;

(b) Credits are non-transferable;

(c) For annual/multi-year billing, Monthly Fee equals annual fee divided by twelve;

(d) You cannot receive both a Service Credit and another refund/credit for the same incident;

(e) You are ineligible if in breach of Terms during Downtime or when submitting a claim;

(f) Claims must be submitted within two calendar months of the Downtime.

**Service Credits are your primary remedy for uptime failures.** However, if service degradation results from Pyro's gross negligence or willful misconduct causing provable business losses substantially exceeding applicable credits, you may pursue direct damages above the credit cap. This limitation of remedies is essential to our agreement, without which the economic terms would differ substantially.

### 5.6 Service Credit Claims

To receive Service Credits:

(a) Submit a support ticket through our online portal within forty-eight (48) hours of incident resolution;

(b) Include in your claim:
   (i) Subject line: "SLA Credit Request";
   (ii) Downtime dates and times;
   (iii) Affected Service identifier;
   (iv) Brief description of the interruption and impact;
   (v) Evidence of Downtime (if available); and
   (vi) Your contact information.

(c) Cooperate with reasonable information requests regarding the claim.

Upon receiving a complete claim, Pyro will:

(a) Verify against monitoring logs and system records;

(b) Determine if the Downtime qualifies for Service Credit; and

(c) Notify you of approval/denial within ten (10) business days, including any approved credit amount.

Pyro's determination is final and binding. Submitting false, misleading, or abusive claims constitutes a material breach of Terms and may result in account suspension/termination and forfeiture of pending claims.

### 5.7 Status Reporting

Pyro maintains a public status page with historical uptime metrics and incident reports for at least twelve (12) months at [status.pyro.host](https://status.pyro.host).

The status page includes:

(a) Real-time system status indicators;

(b) Maintenance announcements;

(c) Incident reports with root cause analysis for major events;

(d) Historical performance metrics; and

(e) Notification subscription options.

We recommend subscribing to status notifications for timely updates. Pyro is not liable for damages resulting from failure to monitor these notifications or respond appropriately.

### 5.8 SLA Modifications

Pyro may modify this SLA in accordance with Section 14. Material changes (such as reduced uptime commitments or credit calculation changes) will follow the notice requirements in Section 14. Non-material changes (clarifications, reorganization, typographical corrections) may be made without prior notice.

Your continued service use after SLA changes constitutes acceptance. If you disagree with changes, your sole remedy is service termination in accordance with these Terms.

## 6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

### 6.1 Pyro's Intellectual Property

All rights, title, and interest in the Services and Pyro's website, including software, applications, APIs, code, technology, architecture, templates, algorithms, interfaces, trademarks, logos, content, and documentation (collectively, "Pyro Materials"), are owned exclusively by Pyro Inc. or its licensors. These materials are protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws internationally.

You receive no ownership rights in the Pyro Materials. No transfer of ownership or intellectual property rights is made or implied by these Terms or your use of the Services. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Pyro and its licensors.

Pyro grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Services and Pyro Materials solely for accessing and using the Services in accordance with these Terms during your subscription. This license is personal and limited to the specific purposes contemplated by these Terms. Any other use requires Pyro's prior written consent.

You must not remove or alter any proprietary notices in Pyro Materials or reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works, publicly display, sell, rent, or otherwise exploit them except as expressly permitted in writing or as allowed by non-waivable applicable law.

Any feedback, suggestions, or recommendations you provide regarding the Services ("Feedback") shall be non-confidential, and Pyro may use, disclose, reproduce, license, distribute, and commercialize such Feedback without restriction or compensation. You grant Pyro a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable license to use, modify, create derivatives of, distribute, and otherwise exploit such Feedback for any purpose.

### 6.2 Your Content Ownership

You retain all rights, title, and ownership of files, data, text, images, software, code, or other content you upload, store, or transmit through our Services ("Content"). Pyro claims no ownership of your Content, and nothing in these Terms grants Pyro ownership rights in your Content.

By making your Content available through the Services, you grant Pyro a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to:

(a) Operate and provide the Services as directed by you;

(b) Create backups as part of standard operations;

(c) Distribute your Content to recipients you designate;

(d) Display and distribute Content as necessary to provide the Services;

(e) Improve the Services (without identifying you or individual users); and

(f) Comply with legal obligations.

This license is limited to what's necessary for service provision and terminates when you delete Content or cease using the Services, except:

(a) Residual copies may remain in backup systems until routinely deleted;

(b) Information required by law or legitimate business interests (billing, tax, compliance); or

(c) Content you've shared with others who haven't deleted it.

### 6.3 Content Responsibility

You are solely responsible for all Content you make available via the Services and for ensuring it complies with this Agreement and applicable laws. Pyro doesn't monitor or control Content and doesn't guarantee its accuracy, integrity, quality, or legality.

By sharing Content through the Services, you represent and warrant that:

(a) You own the Content or have all necessary rights to grant the license described above;

(b) Your Content (and Pyro's permitted use) does not and will not:
   (i) Infringe intellectual property rights;
   (ii) Violate privacy, publicity, or other personal rights;
   (iii) Violate any law or regulation;
   (iv) Contain defamatory, obscene, offensive, or objectionable material;
   (v) Be false or misleading;
   (vi) Contain malicious code; or
   (vii) Impersonate others or misrepresent affiliations;

(c) You've obtained all necessary consents to share personal information or likenesses; and

(d) You've complied with third-party licenses and passed through required terms.

You agree to indemnify Pyro from claims resulting from Content you make available, as detailed in Section 10 (Indemnification).

### 6.4 Content Storage and Backup

Pyro disclaims all liability for indirect or consequential loss or damage to your Content, regardless of cause (system failures, corruption, accidental deletion, etc.). You should maintain current backups of your Content outside Pyro's systems. This applies even if Pyro provides backup services, as these are provided "as is" without warranties.

Maintaining proper data backups is your sole responsibility. Any backup services Pyro provides are conveniences, not replacements for your own backup strategy. You acknowledge that data loss risks exist despite backup services due to technical failures, human error, or unforeseen circumstances.

For service unavailability or data loss directly resulting from Pyro's failure to meet its obligations under the SLA, your exclusive remedy shall be the Service Credits as specified in Section 5.5.

Upon account termination (by you or Pyro), your Content may be permanently deleted after the period specified in our data retention policies or as required by law. Ensure you retrieve all necessary data before termination or upon receiving termination notice.

### 6.5 Intellectual Property Claims

If Pyro receives notice that your Content allegedly infringes intellectual property rights, we may remove or disable access to that Content. For formal DMCA takedown notices, we'll follow procedures in Section 17 (Copyright/DMCA Policy).

Pyro may terminate accounts of repeat intellectual property infringers and reserves the right to remove any Content that violates these Terms or applicable law, with or without formal notice.

If you believe your Content was removed in error or your use is lawful (fair use, etc.), you may submit a counter-notice following procedures in Section 17.

### 6.6 Feedback and Testimonials License

If you provide feedback, suggestions, testimonials, endorsements, recommendations, or reviews regarding the Services ("Testimonials"), you grant Pyro a perpetual, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, create derivatives from, distribute, display, and otherwise use such Testimonials for any purpose, including in marketing and promotional materials. You represent that any Testimonials you provide will be accurate and truthful, based on actual experience, and will disclose any material connection between you and Pyro as legally required.

NOTHING IN THESE TERMS EXCLUDES WARRANTIES THAT CANNOT BE LEGALLY DISCLAIMED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, INCLUDING STATUTORY CONSUMER PROTECTION WARRANTIES. IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE DISCLAIMERS ARE LIMITED, OUR WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED TO THE MINIMUM SCOPE AND DURATION REQUIRED BY LAW.

### 8.1.1 Consumer Statutory Rights

If you are a consumer in the European Union, United Kingdom, or jurisdictions with mandatory statutory guarantees for digital content and services, the following applies despite any contrary provisions:

(a) **EU Digital Content Directive**: Under EU Directive 2019/770, consumers have non-waivable rights including:
   (i) Digital content conforming to descriptions;
   (ii) Updates maintaining conformity during supply;
   (iii) Remedies for non-conformity; and
   (iv) Minimum two-year guarantee for one-time supplies.

(b) **UK Digital Markets, Competition & Consumers Act 2024**: UK consumers have similar guarantees regarding quality, fitness, and conformity.

(c) **Other Jurisdictions**: Mandatory guarantees under other applicable laws are incorporated by reference and prevail over conflicting provisions.

These statutory guarantees cannot be excluded or waived, and you retain all rights and remedies provided under such laws in addition to rights granted in these Terms.

### 8.2 System Reliability Disclaimer

We do not warrant that Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or always available. Despite our high availability targets (per our SLA) and security measures, we cannot guarantee security measures won't be circumvented. Technical difficulties from high traffic or scheduled maintenance may cause interruptions or performance degradation.

Using the Services is at your own risk. Any material downloaded, uploaded, or accessed through the Services is at your discretion and risk. You are solely responsible for any resulting damage to your systems, data loss, or other harm. No advice or support from Pyro creates any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms.

Pyro does not guarantee compatibility with all hardware and software systems or accessibility under all possible combinations of hardware, software, browsers, and settings.

### 8.3 Content Disclaimer

Pyro does not warrant the accuracy, completeness, reliability, timeliness, non-infringement, title, merchantability, or fitness for purpose of any information or content provided through the Services. We disclaim all liability for errors or omissions or results obtained from using such information.

Any reliance on such information is at your own risk. Pyro makes no warranties regarding suggestions or recommendations of services or products offered through the Services. Products and services purchased through the Services are provided "AS IS" without warranty from Pyro.

### 8.4 Third-Party Services Disclaimer

The Services may contain links to third-party websites, applications, or services not owned or controlled by Pyro. Pyro has no control over and assumes no responsibility for third-party content, privacy policies, or practices. Pyro is not responsible for damage or loss caused by or connected with use of or reliance on third-party content, goods, or services.

We recommend reading the terms and privacy policies of any third-party websites, applications, or services you visit or use.

### 8.5 Legal Effect of Disclaimers

Some jurisdictions don't allow certain warranty exclusions or limitations, so some disclaimers may not fully apply to you. In such jurisdictions, implied warranties are limited in duration and scope to the minimum extent permitted by law, but never less than the minimum warranty period required by law.

THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. THESE WARRANTY LIMITATIONS ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF OUR AGREEMENT.

## 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

### 9.5 Jurisdictional Limitations

IN JURISDICTIONS THAT RESTRICT LIABILITY EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS FOR CERTAIN DAMAGES, THE PYRO PARTIES' LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

## 10. INDEMNIFICATION

### 10.1 Indemnification Obligations

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Pyro Inc. and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, licensors, and suppliers (the "Indemnified Parties") from all claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, and fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from:

(h) Disputes between you and third parties relating to your Service use.

### 10.2 Indemnification Procedure

Pyro will promptly notify you of any Claim seeking indemnification, though failure to provide notice doesn't relieve your obligations unless you are materially prejudiced. Upon notice, you shall promptly assume defense with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Pyro.

Pyro reserves the right to assume exclusive defense and control of any indemnifiable matter at our expense. In such case, you agree to:

(a) Cooperate fully with Pyro's defense;

(b) Provide requested information and assistance;

(c) Assist in defending or settling at your expense; and

(d) Not settle any Claim without Pyro's prior written consent.

### 10.3 Remedies

These indemnification obligations are in addition to, not in lieu of, other remedies available to the Indemnified Parties under these Terms or applicable law.

### 10.4 Survival

This indemnification obligation survives any termination or expiration of this Agreement or your Service use, regardless of termination reason, and is enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

## 11. SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION

### 11.1 Suspension by Pyro

Pyro may immediately suspend or restrict your account or Service access, with or without notice, when:

(a) You have violated these Terms;

(b) Your use poses a security risk;

(c) Your use may subject Pyro or others to liability or harm;

(d) Required by law enforcement or government authorities;

(e) You fail to pay fees after collection attempts;

(f) Unusual or suspicious account activity is detected;

(h) Suspension is reasonably necessary to protect our Services, systems, users, or third parties.

During suspension, your data and Content may be inaccessible. Suspension duration depends on the circumstances and continues until the issue is resolved to Pyro's satisfaction.

We will make reasonable efforts to inform you of suspension causes and remediation steps, but disclaim liability for losses resulting from proper suspensions. Suspension doesn't relieve you of payment obligations for fees accrued before or during suspension.

### 11.2 Termination by Pyro

#### 11.2.1 Termination for Cause

Pyro may terminate this Agreement and your Service access:

(a) Immediately without notice for material breach, including:
   (i) Acceptable Use Policy violations;
   (ii) Payment failures after multiple collection attempts;
   (iii) False account information;
   (iv) Fraudulent or unauthorized Service use; or
   (v) Repeated or severe Terms violations;

(b) With written notice if you fail to cure other breaches within ten (10) days; or

(c) Immediately if your account remains suspended for thirty (30) consecutive days.

Termination for cause provides no refund of prepaid fees, and Pyro reserves the right to pursue legal remedies for damages from your breach.

#### 11.2.2 Termination for Convenience

Pyro may terminate this Agreement with thirty (30) days prior written notice for reasons including:

(a) Service, feature, or plan discontinuation;
(b) Strategic business decisions;

For convenience termination, we will refund pre-paid fees for the remaining subscription period on a pro-rated basis from the termination date.

### 11.3 Termination by You

You may terminate this Agreement by:

(a) Canceling through the account interface;
(b) Submitting a support ticket requesting termination; or
(c) Ceasing Service use and providing written termination notice.

Termination requests must follow the cancellation procedure in Section 4. Termination becomes effective at your current billing period's end unless you request earlier termination. Early termination provides no refund for unused portions unless required by law.

### 11.4 Effect of Termination

Upon termination:

(a) Your Service access rights cease immediately. Your account will be disabled and Content access lost (unless specified in data retention policies or required by law);

(b) You must cease using Pyro Materials and destroy any local copies;

(c) All accrued fees become immediately due. If terminated for your breach, remaining term fees also become due as liquidated damages. We may charge your payment method or invoice you;

(d) Pyro may delete your Content and account data after termination, unless legally prohibited or specified in retention policies. Deletion timing varies based on data type, laws, and technical considerations. You are responsible for backing up Content before termination;

(e) Licenses granted to Pyro terminate, except those intended to survive termination; and

(f) Neither party has further obligations except as specified in "Survival of Terms."

### 11.5 Survival of Terms

Provisions that by their nature should survive termination remain in effect, including:

(a) Ownership and intellectual property rights (Section 6);
(b) Payment obligations for services rendered before termination;
(c) Confidentiality obligations;
(d) Warranty disclaimers (Section 8);
(e) Liability limitations (Section 9);
(f) Indemnification obligations (Section 10);
(g) Dispute resolution and arbitration (Section 12);

## 12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

### 12.1 Binding Arbitration

**IMPORTANT: THIS SECTION CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER AFFECTING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. PLEASE READ CAREFULLY.**

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND PYRO AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM, OR CONTROVERSY RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES SHALL BE RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.

THIS PROVISION WAIVES THE RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL AND CLASS ACTION PARTICIPATION. YOU AND PYRO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ALL DISPUTES, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW.

**YOU MAY OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WITHIN 30 DAYS OF ACCEPTING THESE TERMS (SEE SECTION 12.7).**

**EXCEPTION FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:** Nothing in this arbitration agreement prevents you from seeking public injunctive relief in court if you reside in California or states with similar protections. Per McGill v. Citibank, N.A., public injunctive relief claims under California law are not subject to arbitration.

This arbitration agreement applies to all Disputes between you and Pyro, regardless of legal theory or when the Dispute arose. It encompasses all controversies, claims, and disputes that could otherwise be brought in court.

For this arbitration agreement, "Pyro" includes Pyro Inc., its subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, assigns, and their officers, directors, employees, and agents. "You" includes your agents, representatives, heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns.

### 12.2 Arbitration Exceptions

This arbitration requirement does not apply to:

(a) Small claims court cases proceeding on an individual basis;

(b) Intellectual property injunctive or equitable relief claims;

(c) Public injunctive relief claims under laws prohibiting waiver of such rights;

(d) Non-arbitrable claims under federal law (e.g., Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act claims);

(e) Claims under consumer protection statutes prohibiting mandatory arbitration; or

(f) Disputes where applicable law prohibits mandatory arbitration.

Either party may seek emergency court relief to preserve the status quo pending arbitrator appointment or for claims not subject to arbitration.

### 12.3 Pre-Arbitration Resolution

Before initiating arbitration, both parties must attempt informal resolution. To start this process, send a Dispute Notice email to <legal@pyro.host> including: (a) your name and contact information; (b) dispute description and basis; and (c) specific relief sought.

After receiving your notice, Pyro will contact you to schedule a good faith discussion. This informal process must be completed before arbitration may begin. Statutes of limitations and filing deadlines are tolled during this process.

If the Dispute remains unresolved sixty (60) days after Pyro receives your Dispute Notice, either party may commence arbitration.

### 12.4 Arbitration Procedures

Arbitration will be administered by a neutral organization (such as the American Arbitration Association, "AAA") under its applicable rules in effect when arbitration is initiated, as modified by this Agreement. Consumer Disputes use AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules; other Disputes use AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules.

Information about AAA is available at <www.adr.org> or 1-800-778-7879. If AAA is unavailable, the parties will agree on an alternative forum or a court may appoint one.

Arbitration will be conducted in English by one or more neutral, independent arbitrators who must be either (1) a retired judge; (2) a lawyer with at least fifteen years of active practice; or (3) someone with substantial experience in the dispute subject matter. The arbitrator must apply the governing law specified in Section 13 and honor these Terms' limitations as a court would.

### 12.5 Arbitration Location

For consumers (using Services for personal purposes), arbitration may occur in a location convenient for you or remotely by telephone or videoconference.

For all other cases, arbitration will take place in Delaware, USA, unless the parties agree otherwise. Hearings may be conducted via teleconference or videoconference, and claims may be decided on submitted documents without a hearing if the parties agree or rules permit.

### 12.6 Arbitration Costs

Each party bears their own attorneys' fees and arbitration costs unless applicable law or arbitration rules provide otherwise. Consumers with certain claims may recover reasonable fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.

For consumer arbitrations:

- Pyro pays all filing and arbitrator fees for consumer-initiated arbitrations unless the arbitrator finds the claim frivolous or improper
- For claims ≤$10,000, Pyro pays all forum costs regardless of who initiates arbitration
- Arbitration occurs at a location convenient to you or remotely
- AAA Consumer Rules and fee schedule apply (see <www.adr.org>)

For non-consumer arbitrations, filing and arbitrator fees follow forum rules, except Pyro pays all such fees for claims ≤$10,000.

The arbitrator may award any relief a court could grant, including injunctive relief or damages, but only to parties in the proceeding. The arbitrator's decision is final and binding, and judgment may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.

### 12.7 Arbitration Opt-Out

**RIGHT TO OPT OUT:** You may opt out of this binding arbitration agreement by notifying Pyro in writing within thirty (30) days of accepting these Terms. Your notification must include:

(a) Your full name;
(b) Your account information;
(c) A statement that you're opting out of arbitration; and
(d) Your electronic signature.

Send this notification to <legal@pyro.host> with subject "Arbitration Opt-Out".

Opting out affects only the arbitration provisions; all other Terms remain in effect. If you opt out, both you and Pyro may pursue legal proceedings in court.

**Opting out will not adversely affect your relationship with Pyro or Service access.**

### 12.8 Class Action Waiver

YOU AND PYRO AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT. NEITHER PARTY MAY ACT AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS MEMBER REGARDING ANY DISPUTE.

Arbitrators cannot consider or resolve Disputes on a class, collective, or representative basis. If a claim proceeds in court rather than arbitration, both parties waive jury trial rights and agree to proceed solely on an individual basis.

If a court finds this class action waiver unenforceable for a particular claim, that specific claim will be severed and proceed in court, while the arbitration agreement continues to apply to all other aspects of the Dispute.

### 12.8.1 Batch Arbitration Rider

In the event that twenty-five (25) or more substantially similar claims are submitted against Pyro by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations (a "Mass Filing"), the following additional terms shall apply:

(a) All such claims shall be subject to the AAA Mass Arbitration Supplement or similar procedures of the applicable arbitration forum;

(b) The parties agree to consolidate substantially similar claims into a single batch proceeding where feasible;

(c) The parties shall select a representative subset of claims (no more than five) to proceed as "bellwether" proceedings, with the remaining claims stayed pending the outcome of the bellwether proceedings;

(d) The results of the bellwether proceedings may be used to facilitate settlement discussions for the remaining claims;

(e) If the bellwether proceedings do not result in settlement, the parties shall select additional representative claims to proceed in phases of no more than ten claims at a time;

(f) Filing fees and arbitrator compensation for batch proceedings shall be allocated according to the applicable arbitration forum's rules for mass filings; and

(g) This batch arbitration process is designed to promote efficiency and fairness in resolving multiple similar claims while preserving the parties' rights to individualized consideration of their claims.

### 12.9 Time Limitation

Arbitration demands must be filed within one (1) year after the claiming party first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation, claims must be asserted within the shortest legally permitted time period.

Failure to file within the applicable limitation period absolutely bars proceedings in any forum regarding such Dispute. The arbitrator has authority to determine whether the limitation period has been satisfied.

### 12.10 Confidentiality

The parties shall maintain arbitration confidentiality, including all disclosures, discovery, hearings, and awards, except:

(a) As necessary for arbitration preparation or conduct;
(b) For court applications regarding preliminary remedies, award confirmation, or enforcement;
(c) When legally required; or
(d) By mutual agreement.

All participants shall treat the arbitration's existence, content, and result as confidential, except as necessary to enforce the arbitration agreement or comply with legal requirements.

### 12.11 Severability

If any portion of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable:

(a) The unenforceable provision shall be severed;
(b) Severance shall not impact the remainder of the arbitration agreement or the ability to arbitrate remaining claims individually; and
(c) If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable, any class action must proceed in court, not arbitration.

If applicable law precludes enforcing any part of this arbitration agreement for a particular claim, only that claim may be severed and brought in court, subject to appeal rights. All other claims will be arbitrated.

### 12.12 Future Changes

Notwithstanding Section 14 (Changes to Terms), if Pyro changes this arbitration agreement (other than contact information changes), you may reject such changes by sending written notice within thirty (30) days to <legal@pyro.host> with subject "Arbitration Agreement Change Rejection." By rejecting changes, you agree to arbitrate Disputes according to the arbitration agreement language as of the date you first accepted these Terms.

## 13. GOVERNING LAW

### 13.1 Choice of Law

These Terms and any Dispute arising from them or the Services shall be governed by Delaware law, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provisions that would cause application of laws from any other jurisdiction.

This choice of law applies regardless of your location, except where your jurisdiction's law mandates application of another body of law or provides non-waivable statutory protections. This choice of law shall not deprive you of protections afforded by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement under the law that would otherwise apply.

**Consumer Protection: Nothing in this section deprives consumers of mandatory rights under their country of residence's law. If you are a consumer, you benefit from any mandatory provisions of your country's law, and nothing in these Terms limits consumer rights that cannot be waived or limited by contract under applicable law.**

### 13.2 Consumer Protection Exception

If you are a consumer (using the Services for personal purposes) in a jurisdiction where laws mandate different governing law or non-waivable consumer protections, those laws apply to the extent required. Nothing in these Terms restricts consumer rights that cannot be lawfully limited under applicable consumer protection laws.

If you reside in the European Union, United Kingdom, or jurisdictions with comprehensive consumer protection laws, you benefit from mandatory provisions of your country's law. Disputes may be subject to the jurisdiction of courts in your country of residence, and both parties agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of those courts.

### 13.3 Jurisdiction for Non-Arbitrable Disputes

Subject to the arbitration agreement in Section 12, any judicial proceeding (where arbitration is not applicable or enforceable) shall be brought exclusively in Delaware courts. Both parties consent to the personal jurisdiction and exclusive venue of these courts and waive objections based on improper venue, inconvenient forum, or lack of personal jurisdiction.

The parties agree that Delaware courts are appropriate forums for resolving Disputes and that Delaware has a substantial relationship to the parties and this Agreement. You acknowledge that litigation outside Delaware would cause Pyro substantial inconvenience and expense.

### 13.4 Injunctive Relief

Notwithstanding other provisions in these Terms, either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to protect intellectual property rights or confidential information, even if the parties have agreed to arbitrate other disputes. Such action may be filed in any court having jurisdiction over the party against whom relief is sought, and both parties consent to such jurisdiction for this limited purpose.

### 13.5 International Conventions

The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) do not apply to this Agreement, regardless of when or where adopted.

### 13.6 Export Controls

You acknowledge and agree that the Services and any related technical data are subject to applicable export control and trade sanctions laws, regulations, rules, and licenses of the United States and other applicable jurisdictions. You shall comply with all such laws and regulations and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country, territory, or entity to which export is prohibited by such laws.

## 14. CHANGES TO TERMS

### 14.1 Right to Modify Terms

Pyro reserves the right to modify, update, or amend these Terms from time to time in its sole discretion, subject to the limitations and notice requirements set forth herein.

The updated Terms will indicate the "Last Updated" date at the top of the document. It is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically and to maintain accurate contact information in your account settings to ensure receipt of notifications.

### 14.4 Acceptance of Changes

For material changes to these Terms as defined in Section 14.2, we will require your express affirmative acceptance before such changes become effective for you. This will be in the form of a click-through confirmation, a checkbox acknowledgment, or other clear affirmative action indicating your consent to the changes.

(a) We will provide clear notice explaining the changes and their impact;
(b) We will obtain your express consent through a click-wrap agreement requiring affirmative action;
(c) We will maintain records of your consent in accordance with applicable law; and

If you do not agree to a change, you must:

(a) Stop using the Services prior to the effective date of such changes; and
(b) Cancel any paid Services prior to the effective date of such changes by following the cancellation procedures outlined in Section 4.

For material changes to these Terms, if you do not provide affirmative acceptance when prompted, the previous version of the Terms will continue to apply to your use of the Services until the end of your current billing cycle, at which point you must either accept the new Terms or your account will be downgraded to a limited functionality mode or terminated, depending on the nature of the changes.

For users in the European Union, United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions with unfair contract terms regulations, any material changes will only be effective with your express consent, and you retain all rights provided under applicable consumer protection laws regarding unilateral contract modifications.

### 14.5 Non-Material Changes

For non-material changes, Pyro may update the Terms without prior notice to you. Such changes will be effective immediately upon posting the updated Terms on our website. Non-material changes include, but are not limited to:

(a) Corrections of typographical, grammatical, or formatting errors;
(b) Clarifications that do not reduce your rights or increase your obligations;
(c) Updates to contact information, links, or references;
(d) Changes required by law or regulatory requirements; or
(e) Other modifications that do not materially impact your use of the Services or legal rights.

### 14.6 Special Provisions for Certain Changes

Notwithstanding the above, changes to the arbitration provisions in Section 12 shall be governed by Section 12.12 (Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement).

Additionally, if a change to these Terms materially and adversely affects your existing rights with respect to Services for which you have already paid, and such change is not required by law or necessitated by a substantial and unforeseen change in circumstances, then such change will not apply to your use of those Services until your current subscription term expires or is renewed.

## 15. MISCELLANEOUS

### 15.1 Entire Agreement

This Agreement (including documents incorporated by reference) constitutes the entire agreement between you and Pyro regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements and communications.

You acknowledge that you have not relied on any statement or representation not set out in these Terms or documents expressly referenced herein.

No information or advice given by Pyro creates any warranty not expressly stated in this Agreement or modifies its terms. Such information does not increase Pyro's obligations beyond those expressly stated or form a separate agreement.

### 15.2 Severability

If any provision of these Terms is held invalid, illegal, void, or unenforceable:

(a) That provision shall be severed;
(b) The provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible to effectuate the parties' original intent;
(c) All remaining provisions remain in full force and effect; and
(d) The court or arbitrator shall reform the invalid provision to effectuate the original intent while maintaining the original purpose.

The invalidity of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision.

### 15.3 No Waiver

Failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision, nor impair the right to require strict performance at any later time.

No single or partial exercise of any right prevents further exercise of that or other rights. No waiver is effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by an authorized Pyro representative. No course of dealing shall modify these Terms.

### 15.4 Assignment

You may not assign, transfer, delegate, or sublicense this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without Pyro's prior written consent. Any attempted assignment without consent is void.

Pyro may freely assign, transfer, delegate, or sublicense its rights and obligations without your consent in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, asset sale, or by operation of law. Pyro may also assign payment rights without your consent.

This Agreement binds and benefits the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.

### 15.5 Relationship of Parties

You and Pyro are independent contractors. This Agreement creates no partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party may bind the other or incur obligations on the other's behalf without prior written consent.

Nothing in these Terms establishes any partnership or joint venture, constitutes either party as the other's agent, or authorizes either party to make commitments for the other.

### 15.6 Force Majeure

Pyro is not liable for performance failures or delays to the extent they:

(a) Result from events beyond reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, civil disturbances, labor disputes, power outages, internet disruptions, government actions, epidemics, or similar events;
(b) Could not have been prevented by reasonable precautions or circumvented through alternate sources or workarounds; and
(c) Occur without Pyro's fault or negligence.

During such events, Pyro is excused from performing affected obligations while the circumstances persist, provided Pyro makes reasonable efforts to mitigate effects and resume performance as soon as practicable.

### 15.7 Notices

Pyro may provide notices by:

(a) Email to your account address;
(b) Postings in your account portal or website;
(c) Push notifications; or

### 15.8 Headings and Interpretation

Section titles and headings are for convenience only with no legal effect. "Include," "includes," and "including" imply "without limitation." Words in singular or plural include the other form as context requires.

These Terms shall be construed without any presumption against the drafting party. All language shall be construed according to fair meaning, not strictly for or against either party.

### 15.9 Electronic Signatures

By clicking "I agree," checking acceptance boxes, or using the Services, you submit a legally binding electronic signature and enter into a legally binding contract. Your electronic submissions constitute agreement and intent to be bound by these Terms.

You consent to receive electronic communications from Pyro, including emails, texts, push notices, or account messages. You agree that electronic communications from Pyro satisfy any legal writing requirements.

### 15.10 Survival

All provisions that by nature should survive termination shall survive, including ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, liability limitations, dispute resolution, and miscellaneous provisions.

### 15.11 Time Limitation

Any claim arising from these Terms or the Services must be commenced within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred.

If you do not object within this timeframe, you shall be deemed to have accepted the new Sub-processor.

(d) **Objection Right:** If you reasonably object to a new Sub-processor, Pyro shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to you a change in the Services or recommend a commercially reasonable change to your configuration or use of the Services to avoid processing of Personal Data by the objected-to new Sub-processor without unreasonably burdening you. If Pyro is unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed thirty (30) days, you may terminate the affected Services by providing written notice to Pyro. Pyro will refund you any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of such Services following the effective date of termination.

   (i) Transfers to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Data by the European Commission, UK Government, or Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner;
   (ii) Transfers pursuant to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, UK International Data Transfer Addendum, or Swiss Transborder Data Flow Agreement;
   (iii) Transfers pursuant to Binding Corporate Rules; or
   (iv) Transfers pursuant to any other valid transfer mechanism under Applicable Data Protection Law.

(b) **Standard Contractual Clauses:** To the extent that Personal Data is transferred from the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland to a country that does not ensure an adequate level of protection, the parties agree that such transfers shall be governed by the Standard Contractual Clauses, which are hereby incorporated by reference into this DPA. For the purposes of the Standard Contractual Clauses:
   (i) You shall be the "data exporter" and Pyro shall be the "data importer";
   (ii) The description of the transfer in Annex I of the Standard Contractual Clauses shall be deemed to include the information set out in Sections 16.4, 16.5, and 16.6 of this DPA;

### 16.11 Precedence

This section outlines our policy and procedures regarding copyright infringement claims, including the requirements for submitting a valid notification of claimed infringement, our counter-notification procedures, and our policy regarding repeat infringers. By using the Services, you agree to comply with this policy.

### 17.2 Notification of Claimed Copyright Infringement

If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any content or material available through the Services infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512) by providing our Designated Copyright Agent with the following information in writing:

(a) An electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

(b) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site. Please provide a specific description of the material (e.g., book, article, image, etc.) with sufficient detail to enable us to identify the work. Where possible, please include:
   (i) Title of the work;
   (ii) Author or creator of the work;
   (iii) Publication date or registration number, if applicable; and
   (iv) Any other information that would assist us in identifying the work.

(c) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Pyro to locate the material. This should include:
   (i) The specific URL(s) or other precise location(s) where the allegedly infringing material is located;
   (ii) A description of how the material is being used in an infringing manner; and
   (iii) Any other information that would assist us in locating the material.

(d) Your contact information, including your full legal name and email address. We may contact you using this information to seek clarification of your claim or to inform you of our actions in response to your notification.

(e) A statement that you have a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. This statement is made under penalty of perjury.

(f) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Notifications of claimed copyright infringement should be sent to our Designated Copyright Agent as specified in Section 17.5 below.

### 17.3 DMCA Response Procedure

Upon receipt of a valid DMCA notification, Pyro will:

(a) Expeditiously remove or disable access to the content that is alleged to be infringing;

(b) Take reasonable steps to promptly notify the user responsible for the allegedly infringing content that we have removed or disabled access to the content;

(c) Provide the user with a copy of the copyright infringement notification;

(d) Inform the user that they may submit a counter-notification; and

(e) Take appropriate action regarding repeat infringers as described in Section 17.6.

Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability for damages, including costs and attorneys' fees.

### 17.4 Counter-Notification Procedure

If you believe that your content that was removed or to which access was disabled is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to upload and use the content in your user submission, you may send a written counter-notification to our Designated Copyright Agent. To be effective, your counter-notification must include substantially the following:

(a) Your electronic signature.

(b) Identification of the specific material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, and the exact location (URL or other specific location identifier) at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.

(c) A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled. This statement must be based on a genuine belief that the material was wrongfully removed, not merely a disagreement with the copyright owner's claim of infringement.

(d) Your full legal name and email address.

(e) A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which you are located, or if you are outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Pyro may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original notification of alleged infringement or an agent of such person.

Upon receipt of a valid counter-notification, Pyro will:

(a) Promptly provide the person who submitted the original DMCA notification with a copy of the counter-notification;

(b) Inform that person that we will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it in 10-14 business days; and

(c) Replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the counter-notification, unless our Designated Copyright Agent first receives notice from the person who submitted the original DMCA notification that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on our system or network.

Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability for damages, including costs and attorneys' fees.

The Designated Copyright Agent should only be contacted for the purposes of submitting DMCA notifications and counter-notifications. For all other inquiries, please contact Pyro using the contact information provided in Section 15.7 (Notices).

### 17.6 Repeat Infringer Policy

In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws, Pyro has adopted a policy of terminating or permanently restricting, in appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion, the accounts of users who are deemed to be repeat infringers of copyright or other intellectual property rights.

A "repeat infringer" is a user who has been the subject of more than two (2) substantiated DMCA notices or other similar copyright infringement claims within any twelve (12) month period. Pyro may also terminate or restrict the accounts of users who, in Pyro's sole discretion, are repeatedly accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of others, regardless of whether such accusations are ultimately substantiated.

The determination of whether a user is a repeat infringer will be made on a case-by-case basis and at Pyro's sole discretion. Factors that Pyro may consider in making this determination include, but are not limited to:

(a) The number and frequency of DMCA notifications or other intellectual property complaints received about the user;
(b) Whether the notifications or complaints were valid or were successfully contested by the user;
(c) The user's history of compliance with the Terms and this policy;
(d) The nature and severity of the alleged infringements; and
(e) Any other factors Pyro deems relevant.

### 17.7 Modifications to Content

Pyro reserves the right, but not the obligation, to modify, prevent access to, or remove any content that we believe, in our sole discretion, may be unlawful or infringing the intellectual property rights of others, without prior notice to the user who posted or stored such content.

### 17.8 No Legal Advice

Nothing in this Section 17 constitutes legal advice. If you are unsure about your rights or obligations under applicable copyright laws, or how they may apply to your use of the Services, you should consult with a licensed attorney.

Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material is infringing or was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.

- Logical segregation of customer data via multi-tenant architecture with appropriate access controls.
- Multi-factor authentication for administrative access to systems containing Personal Data.
- 24/7 monitoring, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and comprehensive log aggregation.
